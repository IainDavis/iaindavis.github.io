import Expandable from '@site/src/components/Expandable'

I really like Docusaurus, but I also find there are some things it's missing.
Happily, one of the _best_ things about it is that it is, at bottom, React,
which means you can add the things you find missing.

TRUNCATE_HERE

One of the things I run into most frequently that strikes me as a glaring and
puzzling ommission is the lack of a collapsible section of content. To be sure,
markdown generally (and Docusaurus specifically) supports using the `details`
element. But Docusaurus handling of it adds styling I would not choose to add by
default, like so:

> ```
> <details>
> <summary>This is an expandable block</summary>
> 
> It has some additional content that you may opt-in to, or simply pass over as you please.
> It's also obnoxiously removed from the primary flow of the document.
> </details>
> ```
>
> <details>
> <summary>This is an expandable block</summary>
> 
> It has some additional content that you may opt-into, or simply pass over as you please.
> 
> It's also obnoxiously shifted out of the primary flow of the document by
> excessive default styling.
> </details>

This is fine and good if what you want is to highlight something. But very often
what I want is to _elide_ something -- to give the reader only the information
they need at the time, and not bury it in unnecessary content. An example might
be instructions on installing Java. Some subset of your team might need those
instructions if they are new joiners, and it should be there in the flow of the
document where they would expect to find it. But most folks who've been on your
team a while will probably know how to install Java, and can quite happily skip
over those instructions.

So I came up with my own little Expandable component:

---
### Expandable!
<Expandable>

It's discreet, and it leaves the elided content in place in the regular flow of
the document. It also features simple visual elements to clarify the extent of
the expanded portion. It supports content in:

* text
* JSX
* markdown

<h2>Here's some JSX</h2>
</Expandable>
---

Here's what the code/markdown looks like:
```markdown
### Expandable
<Expandable>

It's discreet, and it leaves the elided content in place in the regular flow of
the document. It also features simple visual elements to clarify the extent of
the expanded portion. It supports content in:

* text
* JSX
* markdown

<h2>Here's some JSX</h2>
</Expandable>
```

In addition to the above, it supports starting in the expanded state, and custom
expand/collapse prompts. See the [Storybook](http://localhost:3000/storybook/iaindavis.dev/?path=/docs/custom-components-expandable--docs)

### What I learned from building this component
#### CSS Modules
CSS Modules is the default assumption of Docusaurus. I hadn't much used it
yet... I've used CSS in JS a bit, and `styled-components` a bit. I like CSS
Modules for keeping things, well, modular. And the simplicity and directness of
it is nice. I do like the dynamism that `styled-components` provides though.

#### CSS Pseudo-Selectors
I also had to give myself a little bit of a refresher on pseudo-selectors. I
used `:before` and `:after` to inject the little ornamental circles at the top
and bottom of the left-hand line showing the extent of the expandable section.

### What I still want to do
* I'd love to introduce an 'exclusive' option so that you can assign each one to a
group, and then expanding one block in the group causes the rest to
automatically collapse. Not really sure what the best way to go about producing
the shared state is yet. I suppose maybe swapping out my functional react
component with a class component and storing some of the state on the class
definition, but I'll give it some more thought before I jump in. For now, I'm
happy with how it is.

* I also initially played around with a 'title' property that caused some text to
be rendered above the expandable portion. I eventually landed on the decision
that the surrounding markdown was already suitable for that purpose, but I may
change my mind some time in the future and reintroduce that feature.

* Eventually, I'd like to move this and any other component I build for this
  purpose into their own Docusaurus component library so that I can use them in
  other repositories as well.

* Still need to sort out testing. I've had some difficulty converting my
  Storybook stories to Jest tests. Mostly with the import of various assets
  being handled differently by Storybook, Jest, and Docusaurus. I'm working with
  several tiers of pre-processing (TypeScript, React/JSX, Storybook, Jest) and
  several kinds of files being treated as modules that are not usually (CSS,
  MDX). Getting all those things to work in concert has been something of a
  challenge. I may do another blog post just on that. But in the mean-time, I'm
  thinking of just using Storybook as a showcase, and relying on something
  purpose built for testing. I'm considering giving Playwright a go for
  component testing. Or maybe I'll use the Storybook environment directly,
  rather than running it through Jest, if I can figure out how to automate that.

  Time will tell. For now, I'm happy to have my new little component that makes
  Docusaurus just that little bit more useful to me.
