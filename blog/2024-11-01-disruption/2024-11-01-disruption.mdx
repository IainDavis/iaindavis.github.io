Hello, readers.

Nothing substantive about software development in this post, just a note to explain that I've had some upheaval in my personal life that has meant a significant interruption to the work I'm doing here. I expect to be resuming work here full-speed in the coming days, and picking up my job search where I left off.

Thanks for your understanding.
