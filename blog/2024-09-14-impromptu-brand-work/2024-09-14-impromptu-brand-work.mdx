I didn't intend to create a bunch of brand graphics. I just knew I was going to
have to replace the default docusaurus logos with _something_.

<Logo />

TL;DR: here's the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/dJ0DvH5jER1LKScn4PTnil/IainDavis.dev-Brand-Materials?node-id=5-681&node-type=canvas&m=dev)

<!-- truncate -->

I spent some time prompting AI to suggest me some logos. It didn't really
get what I was after. But it did stir some ideas in me. In the end I settled on
the UML 'lollipop' notation for an interface.

For anybody not familiar with UML, that looks like this:

![UML Component Diagram Interface/Contract relationship notation, or
"Lollipop"](./_resources/lollipop.png)

The element on the right is going to perform some function. As part of that
function, it needs to use another element. Before it can use the other element,
it needs to know that that element _has certain things_ or _can do certain
things_.

That set of needed things is called an interface. The element on the left wants
to use that interface, the one on the right provides an implementation of that
interface. Usually an interface will have a name indicating what an object that
implements it is supposed to do. An object that fulfills a `Downloadable`
interface probably has a function on it called `Download()`. Different
`Downloadable` objects might do that operation in different ways, though.

I landed on this rough concept:

![UML Object 'IainDavis' which provides interface 'dev'](_resources/iaindavis.dev%20lollipop.png)

Conceptually, what that says is "IainDavis" is an entity that can do the set of
things identified by the name "dev". It's graphically nice and clean, and it
says something about what I do to people who are familiar with that kind of
work.

Good so far. But then, it's a little TOO clean isn't it? Just sort of boring in
black and white and default fonts.

The next thing I needed is some colors. I have some experience in colors and
aesthetics, but I really kind of want to move along quickly with this thing and
not get so hung up in every detail. What I really needed is a pre-defined set of
colors that are going to look reasonably attractive together, be distinctive,
and recognizable from a distance. Ideally, they should also relate to my work in
some way, and they should be themable, since I want this website to be a
showcase for what I can do. I should make the most of what Docusaurus offers,
including dark and light themes.

It didn't take me long to land on using syntax highlighting colors. The ones I
chose are from VS Code. The dark theme colors are from the default dark theme,
and the light theme colors are from the Solarized Light theme.

The last thing I needed was fonts. I just picked a couple reasonably attractive
monospace fonts: JetBrains Mono and Fira Code. The rest of my styles are just
the Docusaurus defaults.

Alright, where are we at?

<div style={containerStyle}>
    <div style={{...contraLightStyle, ...paneStyle}} data-theme="light">
        <h3>Light theme</h3>
        <div style={wrapperStyle}>
            <Logo />
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style={{...contraDarkStyle, ...paneStyle}} data-theme="dark">
        <h3>Dark theme</h3>
        <div style={wrapperStyle} >
            <Logo />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<br/>
Hey, that's pretty good! I will definitely use that. But it's a bit too wide to
replace the Docusaurus logo in the navbar with. I need something more compact.

after some adjustments:

<div style={containerStyle}>
    <div style={{...contraLightStyle, ...paneStyle}} data-theme="light">
        <h3>Light theme</h3>
        <div style={wrapperStyle}>
            <Logo variant="compact"/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style={{...contraDarkStyle, ...paneStyle}} data-theme="dark">
        <h3>Dark theme</h3>
        <div style={wrapperStyle} >
            <Logo variant="compact"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Okay, that's good for the remaining stuff. But I still need a favIcon. The
detail in that logo just gets completely lost at the resolution of a browser
tab. I think I can probably just get away with the dark theme for this, though.

<div style={containerStyle}>
    <div style={{...contraDarkStyle, ...paneStyle}} data-theme="light">
        <FavIcon/>
    </div>
</div>

Alright! Clearly part of the same family of icons, but simple enough to read on
a browser tab.

Cool. I think I'm done!

Until I have too long to sit in a Zoom meeting. Jeez this room looks cluttered.
Even with the picture blurred. I look disorganized and messy. I should probably
do some zoom backgrounds. I don't just want flat color though... and I _did_
just upgrade my ChatGPT to plus, which means I can use DALL-E. Ah well, I've got
fifteen minutes left in this workshop. Let's see what I can come up.

_a couple hours later..._

![Abstract image featuring round forms against a rectilinear background in
shades of grey with blue and orange highlights](/img/zoom/zoom-bg-06.png);

I had a lot of fun doing all these things, and as a result I have more
consistent branding across my digital presences: LinkedIn, GitHub, this here 
website.

Initially, I thought I'd get by using the tools I already know best which, for
me, meant draw.io and Inkscape. Unfortunately `draw.io` does some strange stuff
when exporting SVGs with text content, and it doesn't readily give you a way to
convert text content into regular vectors, more's the pity. And Inkscape, while
powerful, proved unequal to the task of correcting draw.io's shortcomings.

Okay, so great for diagrams with loads of annotations, not so good for visual
arts.

In the end I opted to go for Figma. It's what all the design-type people at
Intuit use, and I'm glad I chose it. It made the whole process easier. I
actually re-implemented all of the above graphics all over again from scratch in
Figma, and I learned a lot about that tool along the way.

## What I learned doing this
### AI
I'm always learning more about how to get AI to do things I want it to do. I
never really _did_ get it to do precisely what I wanted... getting DALL-E to
give you something _without_ a point of focus that _doesn't_ try to make use of the full
spectrum from light to dark is surprisingly difficult. It's learned a lot of
rules about what makes a picture 'good' that it doesn't want to unlearn. But I
didn't want "art" so much as "texture". **I** want to be the focus in my Zoom call.

I did ask it to give me things that evoke technology, and particular the process
of designing software, and it did surprisingly well at that task, I think.

### Figma
Figma is pretty great! I think by far my favorite thing was discovering I could
do theme-ing right in the tool. If you look at my Figma for this work, there's a
dark and light version of each logo... those are actually copies of the exact
same object, just with a different set of variables applied. I was so interested
in that, I shelled out the $144 for a paid license for a year. Super cool.

And now I have all my brand materials consolidated in one place, which is nice.
