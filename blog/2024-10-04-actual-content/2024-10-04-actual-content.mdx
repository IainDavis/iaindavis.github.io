It's been a while since I posted here!

Actually, I posted here about a week ago about some of the things I
was working on with Nova, but I wrote it in a bit of a rush, and I
_**hated**_ that blog post. It was disorganized and the content didn't
really relate to the title at all, so I deleted it.

Since then, this week and a goodly chunk of last week have been all about producing content
for this here website.

TRUNCATE_HERE

### Projects
I've finally put some flesh on the [projects
section][section-projects]. At the moment, this is limited to this
here website and Nova. I felt like I was spending enough time on Nova
that they deserved the 'project' status. I [externalized all her various
instructions into a GitHub repo][]. When I get back to
actually working on it, I'll likely add a page for my GMail Tools
AppsScript project.

Each section features a quick overview, relevant links, challenges
faced, and a more detailed summary of details.

### Bio
I've added a [new Bio section][section-bio]. I considered just
mirroring my LinkedIn bio here, but it seemed like an opportunity to
go into a bit more depth and add a bit of color to the picture of who
I am. The rest of the site is pretty business-like. If someone wants
the briefer synopsis, they still have the overview page and the
LinkedIn profile they can go to.

### New Components
I've written [a handful of very simple React
components][bio-components] during this work. I kind of thought they'd
be just use-once components, so I've just defined them in place, but
in retrospect, I think they probably have some utility outside the bio
section. For now, I've left them where they are, but I've scheduled
some work on my backlog to move them into the appropriate location and
write tests and stories for them. There'll likely be a round of
refinement as well, since they're pretty basic at the moment.

The new components do roughly two things:
* Make use of the CSS `float` property to float a section of content
  which allows more interesting layouts with very little additional overhead
* Generate a delimited set of links within an MDX document. In place,
  allowing a set of links to be defined [in the frontmatter header][yaml-frontmatter]

<Demos/>

### Other Things
I've added a good bit of capability to Nova. She can now submit Jira
tickets for me, as well as PR reviews. It's so much easier now to
capture an idea that happens in flow without _leaving_ the flow. And
I've added a build stage that generates a map of my repository (using
the command-line utility `tree`) which Nova can use to infer the
locations of files in my repository, which really has streamlined
getting Nova on the same page as me when discussing a set of changes
to a file.

### Coming Soon
#### New Content
- Katas page
- Update footer and Navbar
- Gmail Tools project page

#### Catching up
- Need to flesh out the test suite, now that it's all automated, then bump up
  coverage limits
- Fix up my Logo component so it's scalable (you can see a place where it
  _ought_ to scale, but _doesn't_ on the [project overview page][website-project-overview] for this website)
- Add styleguide, linting, Git hooks, prose checking, all that stuff. Probably
  lower priority than content and getting more aggressive about job-hunting at
  this stage.

#### New features
I think I'm going to add a menu for selecting a preview environment, and a
visual indicator that lets you know when you're _in_ a preview environment.
Haven't really figured out how I'm going to go about that yet, but it does give
me a meaningful interaction with an API, which is something I wanted to add
here.

#### Putting Lipstick on a Pig
I've got a little section of images and videos from my various hobbies in the
bio section. It's currently just a CSS flex-box, and it looks attrocious. I
think I'm going to change that to a carousel, which is probably going to finally
force me to commit to one component library or another. There'll be some
research to do there, and I'm glad I've got Nova to help me do it.

#### Nova
I've got a few tickets in to do some refinements on Nova. At the moment, I have
to continually remind her of my Jira project key, and the format she's supposed
to use to submit requests. A few other things that rub a bit.

Lots to do. I doubt I'll get through all of it in the next couple weeks, but
we'll see how far I _do_ get. Stay tuned.
