## Streamlining the Deployment Pipeline

Today, we took a major step toward automating the deployment of this site,
eliminating manual steps and reducing the risk of errors.

Now, every pull request (PR) generates a preview build, and every merge to the
`main` branch automatically triggers a production deployment. This new setup
speeds up the process, ensures consistency, and minimizes the chances of
mistakes.

### Why This Matters

- **No More Manual Deployments**: Previously, deploying required manual steps
  from my local machine, which added risk. Now, everything is automated—merges
  to `main` deploy directly to production.
  
- **Faster, More Reliable**: Each PR has its own preview environment, so I can
  verify changes before they go live. Once merged, they deploy automatically.

- **Reduced Mental Overhead**: The process used to require careful sequencing of
  build steps. That’s all automated now, freeing up more focus for actual
  development.

### Key Changes

1. **Preview Builds for PRs**: Each PR generates a preview environment for easy
   review.
2. **Automated Production Deployments**: Merges to `main` trigger a pipeline
   that handles everything from building the site to updating Storybook and test
   reports.
3. **Error Handling**: If anything fails during the build or deploy, I get
   immediate feedback via GitHub Actions, and the deployment halts.

### The Bottom Line

The new automated pipeline is faster, more reliable, and takes much less effort.
I can now focus more on building features, confident that the deployment process
is working smoothly in the background.
