Over the past few days, we've built an automated system to streamline the creation of personalized cover letters using Google Apps Script. This integration automates the process of generating, storing, and accessing cover letters directly from a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

### Key Accomplishments

- **Efficient Cover Letter Creation**: Users can now generate cover letters with a single click, eliminating manual editing.
- **Automated Document Management**: Documents are automatically organized in Drive for easy access and tracking.
- **User-Friendly Integration**: A custom menu in Google Sheets makes it simple to trigger the entire process without needing to handle any code.

### The Problem

Creating unique cover letters for each job application was a time-consuming and error-prone task. Manually inserting details such as company name, job title, and referral source required repetitive effort for every application.

### The Solution

We developed an automation that uses data from Google Sheets to generate custom cover letters and organize them in Google Drive. Here’s how the system works:

1. **Data Entry**: Key details—like company name, job title, and referral source—are stored in a Google Sheet.
   
2. **Automated Cover Letter Generation**: A script populates a pre-designed Google Docs template with this data, creating customized cover letters automatically.

3. **Organized Storage**: The generated documents are saved in Google Drive, categorized by company and job title for easy retrieval.

4. **Quick Access Links**: The system adds a clickable link to the generated cover letter back in the spreadsheet for fast access.

### Benefits

This system saves time, reduces errors, and improves consistency in document creation. It also provides clear organization in Google Drive, making it easy to find and manage cover letters for each application.
