One of the first things my outplacement coach told me was that I ought to be
posting to LinkedIn regularly. I knew I wanted to have updates specific to this
website here on my blog, and I figured I'd just have to cross-post them
manually.

It turns out that's not so!

TRUNCATE_HERE

The Docusaurus plugin that is behind this blog natively provides the option to generate
an RSS feed. I did some exploration and found that LinkedIn actually supports
_consuming_ an RSS feed and generating posts from it natively! Hey, that's
great! Problem solved!

(My RSS feed is [here](https://iaindavis.dev/blog/rss), if you're interested)

Except LinkedIn supports consuming RSS feeds natively **if** you have a business
page. I'm not a business. I'm just some guy. And I really don't want more LinkedIn
management on my plate.

I figured somebody had probably licked this problem before, and I was right!

Check out [Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/home). They offer no-code
configuration for automating tasks. You configure a trigger (new content in my
RSS feed), an action (share it to LinkedIn), and provide any necessary
credentials/authorizations and you're off and running. Anytime you see a
LinkedIn post from prefixed "Latest from my developer blog:" that's exactly
what's happened.

I'm on the free trial right now. For my purposes I'm not sure it's going to be
worth the $20 USD/month price tag. But maybe I can find an alternative, or
figure out how to do something similar myself with APIs.

If you have a business that's producing income, maybe $20 USD is worth it to
you.

Also, if you're getting spammed by me, I promise this content will slow down.
I've been trying to catch up documenting the things I've done over the last few
weeks.


That's all for now!
