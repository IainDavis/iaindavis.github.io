<p>Most people don’t want more paperwork in their lives. But this tool isn't about micromanagement, metrics, or billable hours. It's about:</p>
<ul>
<li>🧠 <strong>Remembering what you’ve done</strong></li>
<li>💬 <strong>Telling your story when it counts</strong> (like performance reviews or job interviews)</li>
<li>📈 <strong>Recognizing patterns in your own growth</strong></li>
<li>🧭 <strong>Keeping yourself aligned with your goals</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s designed to be low-friction and easy to maintain. No software to install. No account to create. Just a spreadsheet that actually <em>helps</em> you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works-in-plain-english">How It Works (In Plain English)<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2025/05/30/2025-05-30-personal-work-log/personal-work-log#how-it-works-in-plain-english" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How It Works (In Plain English)" title="Direct link to How It Works (In Plain English)">​</a></h2>
<p>At its heart, the tool is a <strong>log of daily accomplishments</strong>.<br>
<!-- -->Each time you complete something meaningful—whether it’s writing a design doc, fixing a nasty bug, mentoring a teammate, or even learning something new—you jot it down.</p>
<p>Each entry can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>project or area</strong> it relates to</li>
<li>A short <strong>description of the work</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>skills or competencies</strong> it demonstrates (you choose from a set tailored to <em>you</em>)</li>
<li>A checkbox for “Have I shared this with my manager?”</li>
<li>Optional tags for personal notes, learning goals, or career themes</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, the sheet automatically builds out <strong>dynamic views</strong> that help you explore and reflect on your work:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>daily view</strong> of what you accomplished</li>
<li>A <strong>project-based view</strong> showing contributions across initiatives</li>
<li>A <strong>competency view</strong>, so you can see how you’re growing in areas like collaboration, design thinking, or process improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these views updates automatically. You change one entry, and the entire system keeps itself tidy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-makes-it-special">What Makes It Special<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2025/05/30/2025-05-30-personal-work-log/personal-work-log#what-makes-it-special" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Makes It Special" title="Direct link to What Makes It Special">​</a></h2>
<p>Beyond its practicality, the work log embraces a few important principles:</p>
<p>🧩 <strong>You own the categories</strong><br>
<!-- -->Whether you care about mentorship, craft, or strategic impact, you can tailor the tool to reflect what <em>you</em> value.</p>
<p>🖌 <strong>It’s human-friendly</strong><br>
<!-- -->No walls of raw data. Instead, it uses colors and formatting to give you quick visual cues—what competencies were demonstrated? What patterns are emerging?</p>
<p>🛠 <strong>It evolves with you</strong><br>
<!-- -->Want to track something new? Just add a column. The rest updates itself.</p>

<p>Along the way, we discovered some important lessons—about tools, but also about ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflection is a skill.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Keeping a work log isn’t just about record-keeping. It helps you build awareness about what matters, what energizes you, and where you’re growing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple doesn’t mean trivial.</strong><br>
<!-- -->The humble spreadsheet turned out to be a surprisingly powerful canvas for designing a meaningful system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automate the boring bits.</strong><br>
<!-- -->The goal isn’t to make you do more work. It’s to remove the overhead so that your focus stays on the <em>content</em> of your work, not the mechanics of tracking it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Every job is more than tasks.</strong><br>
<!-- -->What you accomplish can’t always be measured in tickets closed or emails sent. Sometimes your most important work is the invisible stuff: improving a process, mentoring a peer, or simply making a tough day easier for someone else. This log helps you make that visible.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This tool was built for one person, but it’s designed to be adaptable for anyone.<br>
<!-- -->If you're curious, reach out. We’re looking into ways to make it easy for others to copy, configure, and start using without friction.</p>
<p>Because your work matters—and your story deserves to be told.</p>

Now I'm able to submit new work ideas, correctly categorized, with less friction.</p></div></div>
<p>I've been pretty lax about working in a structured and organized way in my personal projects. Some of that has to do with life just kind of being a bummer lately. Unemployment is hard. But it also has to do with I just got into some sections of work that felt very unstructured and exploratory. I knew roughly where I wanted to get to, but I didn't know how to get there until I did a lot of learning and made a bunch of mistakes. Now, arguably, that's exactly the kind of stuff I should have been documenting. But <em>doing</em> it took a lot of my time and energy. Today, we're where we are, and there's no use pretending we're somewhere else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the good thing about knowing where we are, is we get to decide what we're going to do next! And one of the things I'm going to do is, now that the work has settled into something that feels a little more predictable and structured, to return to the good practices that I was trying to follow when I first got laid off and decided to start pursuing my own projects so that I could have something to showcase to the world.</p>
<p>That means posting on this here blog, and tracking my work in Jira, and running something approximating a scrum workflow. I don't really want to work in Scrum, I'd much rather do Kanban for my personal projects, but I think it's important that I practice for my next role, which very often means Scrum.</p>
<p>Bad news though. I let it go so long that my Jira instance got deleted. In fact, I got a warning before that happened, and I contacted somebody at the help desk who assured me all I had to do to keep it live was to log in once in a while. I don't know if he was mistaken, or I misunderstood, or if it's just been longer since that conversation than I realize, but my Jira instance got deleted, and I'm left with not much to do but start over.</p>
<p>It may be a blessing in disguise though. When I first set up my Jira instance, I built in the way that I recognized from my time at Intuit, that is, a project-per-team. And since my "team" is only me and my AI assistant, Nova, that meant I had a single project with different work streams only identifiable by labels and components. Looking at it objectively, that never really made much sense, and even less so now that I have more than one project that I'm working on.</p>
<p>Rebuilding my Jira instance with a one-project-per-product model had some other benefits too. Now I have a Sandbox project where I can try things out with Jira configurations and integrations, and I can still keep any issues generated during those activities around for future reference without polluting my actual work-stream information. I also have an IDEAS project, where I can capture things that might be developed more fully into new epics, and might even spawn new projects (I've got several of these already that I want to capture).</p>
<p>I also improved on my previous model by introducing a "Tags" field (which I'm seriously considering renaming... "Tags" is too generic for its purpose). The "Tags" field acts essentially the same as the standard "Labels" field, except that "Tags" only allows values from a defined set. Why is that useful? Suppose you're relying on labels to identify how much effort is going into various aspects of development. Suppose one of your team adds the label "docs" and another one adds the label "documentation". Now, to get an accurate picture, you <em>have to know both of those labels exist</em>. This strikes me as singularly error prone, so I invested the time to create a set of options that divide development work into different categories. These work in concert with the Components field. Components define where-in-the-project work is happening, <em>e.g.</em> a specific module or somewhere within the configuration-as-code, and "Tags" identify what sort of work it is, <em>e.g.</em>, adding tests, a new feature, or refactoring.</p>
<p>All of this custom configuration comes at a cost. Previously, it was pretty easy for Nova to interact with my Jira instance. There was only one project key to know, and pretty much everything had the standard configuration. I needed Nova to be able to discover the current configuration on the fly, and to notice when it changes.</p>
<p>The obvious first step was to try to fetch all this through the API. Nova has a set of GPT Actions, and a dedicated OAuth2 app and account that allows login to my Jira instance, and this mostly works, but we did run into a wrinkle we couldn't resolve through the API. Discovering the allowed values for the "tags" field requires access to an "Edit Workflows" permission that is simply not grantable to a user who is authenticating via an OAuth2 log in flow. I'm not sure why that permission shouldn't be grantable, or why it's neaded to read a bit of configuration that would be perfectly viewable for the same user through the UI, but here we are.</p>
<p>The solution has been to add <em>another</em> project to Jira, explicitly for exposing information in a way that Nova can retrieve it. I call this project "Nova Integration" or "NOVAINT", and it supports a single custom issue type (or work type, under the new naming scheme), which is <code>ContextCard</code>. Nova can retrieve ContextCards and treat anything in them as valid context for the remainder of the session.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screen capture of the custom &amp;quot;Add Context Card&amp;quot; screen in Jira" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/add-context-card-52170f83e4725f8ad935dd85edad1969.png" width="821" height="864" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Alternatives I considered</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>I considered several different approaches for providing Nova with the details of the Tags field</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>abandoning it altogether</strong>
This is always a possibility. But I didn't relish the idea of having to remind Nova of the same information over and over again, especially considering there might be variations of the allowed values from one project to another. Also I'm quite stubborn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>including it in Nova's instructions</strong>
This was the earliest and most obvious solution. Simple and direct, but it also would have me not only having to manually maintain Nova's instructions, but to do it outside of Jira. It seems prudent to me to control what Jira exposes from within Jira. I also wanted to avoid polluting Nova's instructions with a lot of detail. The more that's in there, the more likely Nova will get confused about something. Indeed, with just the instructions that <em>are</em> there, we had to do a fair bit of troubleshooting to get Nova not to assume that one project was more important than the others, based on unrelated instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>including it in Nova's knowledge base</strong>
This has the advantage of preserving separation of concerns and not polluting Nova's instructions with too much detail, but it suffers from the same need to control Jira-visibility from outside Jira.</p>
</li>
</ol></div></div></details>

<p>The end result of all this is that Nova can now dynamically discover what is needed to smooth the creation of new issues in Jira based on our conversations. If we're discussing an idea, and I say "let's capture that as a ticket", Nova can infer the project, components, and tags that are relevant for that work, and populate the ticket as needed with minimal intervention.</p>

Or it might just be that Nova takes her instructions before an action, and can't augment those instructions based on input recieved during that execution. Not really sure yet, but it seems like an interesting thing to experiment with.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>I've split off a separate component library called <a href="https://github.com/IainDavis-dev/docodylus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Docodylus Github repository">Docodylus</a></li>
<li>I've built a custom internationalization layer for Docodylus on top of Polyglot</li>
<li>refactored it into a monorepo (a couple times, actually), and am now preparing to release it into the wild as an open-source project on NPM (just as soon as get the quality-check-and-release pipeline in place)</li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>It's been a long while. I haven't been posting, and virtually nothing has changed here at IainDavis.dev. But I haven't been idle either. Since I last was regularly updating, I made several decisions that have taken a good long while to carry out, and I abandoned some structure and communication while I was doing it. In retrospect, it was maybe unwise, but at the time it felt like quite enough to be dealing with all the things I was dealing with and also be doing the learning I needed to do to implement the changes I wanted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And look, it has to be said. Things haven't been great for me. That's not a complaint, just an acknowledgment of my limitations. I'm only human, and the last few months have been a lot.</p>
<p>First I'll give a general recap (at a very broad level) of what I've been up to and then, in another post, I'll discuss more recent updates, with an eye towards resuming regular updates on this blog again.</p>
<p>Here's what I've been doing:</p>
<p>Back when I started adding custom React components to IainDavis.dev, I had a couple of forward-looking notions. The ffirst notion was that it would be smart to make an external library to hold those components, so I could reuse them across projects. In fact, I've had that idea for a long time: that I ought to have a central place to put re-usable units of code, and that could double as a place to share out work that I've done that isn't someone else's intellectual property. The second notion was that I wanted to explore things like internationalization a bit more. I'd used systems already in place, but I'd never had to add it to a greenfield project. In iaindavis.dev, I had configured components with externalized strings as a sort of place-holder for a later, more robust internationalization approach.</p>
<p>I decided that it wasn't going to be any easier to migrate components from iaindavis.dev to an external library if I waited until there were more of them, and <a href="https://github.com/IainDavis-dev/docodylus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Docodylus Github repository">Docodylus</a> was born.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Docodylus logo - A bipedal crocodile wearing a suit and oxford shirt with no tie and the shirt untucked is carrying a briefcase. He walks with purpose, as if he is on his way to sort out your documentation for you. Next to him is the word &amp;quot;Docodylus&amp;quot; in a conservative but attractive serif font." src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/Docodylus_sillhouette_logo_-32ca8fa155915555b8374cf58c65ee9c.webp" width="2835" height="945" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>why "Docodylus?"</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Docodylus was born out of Docusaurus. I thought it would be fun to preserve the association with dinosaurs, but also indicate a small evolutionary step. I tried several variations using latin words associated with inheritors of the dinosaur genetic legacy (birds: Ornidocs? Docoraptor?, sharks... no real recognizable latin term to use that people will immediately identify as "shark") but they all felt really clunky and stupid. Docodylus (that latin name for the family of crocodiles is <em>crocodylus</em>) was the only one that felt like it had any flow-and-swagger to it at all, so I went with that. And how that I have the logo, I can't imagine it being anything else. I love that guy.</p></div></div></details>
<p>Docodylus is intended as a React component library for enhancing documentation and other React-based static websites. Right now, there's only one component in it, and a handful more within iaindavis.dev, waiting their turn to get migrated. All of these are quite simple, but I have plans for more complex and robust components in the future, for example an RSS feed display, so I can bring my social media activity into my website, and an external document viewer to standardize and simplify making external content visible in Docusaurus (I'm primarily focused on Google Drive documents but will try to be as general as might be useful)</p>
<p>In the course of migrating the Expandable component over, I decided it was as good a time as any to implement the internationalization layer. To be fair, I haven't implemented anything like full internationalization. So far, I haven't needed any other features than translations, so dates, currency, number formats are all potential future work. What I <em>did</em> do though, was to make a lot of decisions to support the design goals of Docodylus, namely delivering only what's needed and customizability.</p>
<p>Modularity in Docodylus (with respect to i18n) is supported by a custom layer that sits on top of Polyglot. It's essentially a re-implementation of polyglot-react, with a couple of new features. Language files are lazy-loaded based on the locale (specified by the user with a React <code>Context.Provider</code> called <code>I18nProvider</code>) and cached so that the same language file doesn't have to be loaded twice. To be perfectly frank here, language files aren't that big, and I'll probably never support enough languages for it to matter, so this was <em>mostly</em> a learning exercise for me, but I did learn a good bit about React hooks, etc.</p>
<p>Customizability is not yet supported beyond passing strings to components as properties and having the component explicitly use those strings, but groundwork has been laid. Docodylus uses a TypeScript component to aggregate the ids of translatable strings for <em>every component loaded, and no others</em> into a common type which then will populate the user's code-hints with the allowable, namespaced keys for Docodylus translatable strings. This will allow a user to wholesale override all the default translations for every language Docodylus natively supports, as well as allowing them to supply translations for languages that Docodylus does not natively support.</p>
<p>Docodylus's i18n layer also supports locale negotiation, which is not supported by Polyglot natively, so if a user requests locale <code>en-CA</code> and there are no Canada-specific translations, Docodylus will fall back automatically to the <code>en</code> locale.</p>
<p>After the internationalization layer was in place, I set about getting test coverage in place. That's mostly unit tests at this point, although there are a few integration tests as well, specifically for the i18n layer.</p>
<p>When I initially set up the project, I made it as a single package. I knew eventually I wanted each component to be independently publishable to NPM, but early exploration made me think that was not going to be terribly difficult, so I deferred it until I had something to work on. I was mistaken that it would be trivial. The next significant chunk of work I engaged with was decomposing the library into discrete modules with hard dependency boundaries.</p>
<p>It took several iterations to get a result I was happy with, and a <em>lot</em> of learning about how the different tools that go into making a monorepo work together. At one point, I had the entire thing implemented with Typescript packages. That exposed the vendor lock-in I had created by relying on the Vite-only feature of <code>import.meta.glob</code>, so I refactored, adding a new module to manage dynamic loading of external files <em>without</em> relying on vendor-specific compile-time constructs. And then I decided I really probably wanted Vite packages anyway, to have the advantages of bundling and tree-shaking. I'm not sorry though, that vendor lock-in might well have come back and bit me in the ass before long.</p>
<p>Once I had that refactored, and everything running just the way I wanted it, Storybook stopped working altogether. That was baffling for a while, but ultimately it turned out that, because I had made independent packages of everything, Storybook was just trying to use the built artifacts, instead of building them itself from the typescript source. The toolchain used by my builds and that expected by Storybook didn't match up, so Storybook couldn't understand my built modules. I was able to solve that by learning some new things about how conditional exports work, enabling Storybook to read from source again.</p>
<p>And that more or less brings us to today. The next major chunk of work is to finalize all my automation, tests, quality checks, etc. and Docodylus will be ready to go live on NPM as a tool that other people can use (but probably shouldn't, at least until I get some more actual features into it).</p>
<p>I'm looking to get on with that in the next week, and also to return to more structured work, and more regular communications about the work. More on that in the next blog post.</p>
<p>There's loads of work to do after I publish (as prerelease). I've got a ton of documentation to write, and the component that's in there is bare-bones to say the least. There are features to add, and I've learned a good deal about accessibility since I initially wrote it, which I want to incorporate. That has consequences for CSS that may lead me into writing an entire design system... time will tell. And then there are other existing components to migrate, new components to write, and the <em>actual origiinal website</em> to update and maintain in an ongoing way.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brief update to indicate some of the work I've done here in the last few days:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Minor security updates prompted by GitHub's Dependabot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrading Docusaurus: <code>v3.5.2</code> → <code>v3.6.0</code></p>
<p>This implies a transition from <code>webpack</code> to the rust-based equivalent <code>Rspack</code>. I'm a bit concerned that may have some consequences for the existing interactions between vite, babel, and webpack, but so far all seems well.</p>
<p>Happily looking forward to improved Mermaid support. Hopefully I can take advantage of interactive menus in rendered Mermaid diagrams, though I haven't tested this, and it sounds as though it may require some additional configuration to override the default mermaid version for a newer one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a separate instance of the Docusaurus blog plugin for hands-on exercises</p>
<p>I've been wanting a way to capture and publish this activity for a while. Indeed, it's part of the reason I wanted this website to exist in the first place -- partly for making visible to potential employers any activites that aren't encompassed in projects, but also for my own reference if I should want to look back on things I've previously learned.</p>
<p>I've gone through several iterations of this, either in concept or in partial implementation. Each version has varied in which elements are stored in their own independent repository, and which elements were stored here. In the end, I've landed on a hybrid solution with the actual solution files in <a href="https://github.com/IainDavis/book-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their own repository</a> and the documentation in this repository, allowing me access to all Docusaurus offers when describing my efforts, as well as the custom components I've created.</p>
<p>Using the Docusaurus <code>blog</code> plugin gives me a historical record of what I've done, as well as being searchable by tags. At the moment, I'm intending to group tags into three rough categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>exercise source (usually a book, but maybe sometimes a video or other document)</li>
<li>kind: (hands-on exercies, commentary, etc.)</li>
<li>topic/tech: allow me to filter all results that have to with (for example) NGINX, regardless of where the exercise came from</li>
</ul>
<p>An earlier iteration intended to use the existing blog, but I saw several advantages in splitting it off into a separate instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent RSS feeds prevent me spamming LinkedIn with information not related to the development of my projects</li>
<li>Avoid polluting my main <code>tags</code> file with a lot of tags for various exercise sources, and individual technologies, where more general categories are appropriate</li>
<li>It's useful to separate the histories... if I want to review all the exercises I've done that leveraged NGINX, I don't necessarily want every mention of NGINX from my main blog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Creating unique cover letters for each job application was a time-consuming and error-prone task. Manually inserting details such as company name, job title, and referral source required repetitive effort for every application.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution">The Solution<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/10/06/2024-10-06-cover-letter-automation/cover-letter-automation#the-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Solution" title="Direct link to The Solution">​</a></h3>
<p>We developed an automation that uses data from Google Sheets to generate custom cover letters and organize them in Google Drive. Here’s how the system works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Entry</strong>: Key details—like company name, job title, and referral source—are stored in a Google Sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Cover Letter Generation</strong>: A script populates a pre-designed Google Docs template with this data, creating customized cover letters automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organized Storage</strong>: The generated documents are saved in Google Drive, categorized by company and job title for easy retrieval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Access Links</strong>: The system adds a clickable link to the generated cover letter back in the spreadsheet for fast access.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This system saves time, reduces errors, and improves consistency in document creation. It also provides clear organization in Google Drive, making it easy to find and manage cover letters for each application.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since I posted here!</p>
<p>Actually, I posted here about a week ago about some of the things I
was working on with Nova, but I wrote it in a bit of a rush, and I
<em><strong>hated</strong></em> that blog post. It was disorganized and the content didn't
really relate to the title at all, so I deleted it.</p>
<p>Since then, this week and a goodly chunk of last week have been all about producing content
for this here website.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="projects">Projects<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/10/04/2024-10-04-actual-content/actual-content#projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Projects" title="Direct link to Projects">​</a></h3>
<p>I've finally put some flesh on the <a title="Projects section" href="https://iaindavis.github.io/docs/projects/iaindavis.dev">projects
section</a>. At the moment, this is limited to this
here website and Nova. I felt like I was spending enough time on Nova
that they deserved the 'project' status. I [externalized all her various
instructions into a GitHub repo][]. When I get back to
actually working on it, I'll likely add a page for my GMail Tools
AppsScript project.</p>
<p>Each section features a quick overview, relevant links, challenges
faced, and a more detailed summary of details.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio">Bio<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/10/04/2024-10-04-actual-content/actual-content#bio" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bio" title="Direct link to Bio">​</a></h3>
<p>I've added a <a title="Bio section" href="https://iaindavis.github.io/docs/bio/bio">new Bio section</a>. I considered just
mirroring my LinkedIn bio here, but it seemed like an opportunity to
go into a bit more depth and add a bit of color to the picture of who
I am. The rest of the site is pretty business-like. If someone wants
the briefer synopsis, they still have the overview page and the
LinkedIn profile they can go to.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-components">New Components<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/10/04/2024-10-04-actual-content/actual-content#new-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Components" title="Direct link to New Components">​</a></h3>
<p>I've written <a href="https://github.com/IainDavis/iaindavis.github.io/tree/main/docs/bio/bio/_components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a handful of very simple React
components</a> during this work. I kind of thought they'd
be just use-once components, so I've just defined them in place, but
in retrospect, I think they probably have some utility outside the bio
section. For now, I've left them where they are, but I've scheduled
some work on my backlog to move them into the appropriate location and
write tests and stories for them. There'll likely be a round of
refinement as well, since they're pretty basic at the moment.</p>
<p>The new components do roughly two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make use of the CSS <code>float</code> property to float a section of content
which allows more interesting layouts with very little additional overhead</li>
<li>Generate a delimited set of links within an MDX document. In place,
allowing a set of links to be defined <a href="https://github.com/IainDavis/iaindavis.github.io/blob/main/docs/bio/bio/bio.mdx?plain=1#L3-L18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the frontmatter header</a></li>

<p>I've added a good bit of capability to Nova. She can now submit Jira
tickets for me, as well as PR reviews. It's so much easier now to
capture an idea that happens in flow without <em>leaving</em> the flow. And
I've added a build stage that generates a map of my repository (using
the command-line utility <code>tree</code>) which Nova can use to infer the
locations of files in my repository, which really has streamlined
getting Nova on the same page as me when discussing a set of changes
to a file.</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to flesh out the test suite, now that it's all automated, then bump up
coverage limits</li>
<li>Fix up my Logo component so it's scalable (you can see a place where it
<em>ought</em> to scale, but <em>doesn't</em> on the <a title="Website project overview" href="https://iaindavis.github.io/docs/projects/iaindavis.dev">project overview page</a> for this website)</li>
<li>Add styleguide, linting, Git hooks, prose checking, all that stuff. Probably
lower priority than content and getting more aggressive about job-hunting at
this stage.</li>

<p>I think I'm going to add a menu for selecting a preview environment, and a
visual indicator that lets you know when you're <em>in</em> a preview environment.
Haven't really figured out how I'm going to go about that yet, but it does give
me a meaningful interaction with an API, which is something I wanted to add
here.</p>

<p>I've got a little section of images and videos from my various hobbies in the
bio section. It's currently just a CSS flex-box, and it looks attrocious. I
think I'm going to change that to a carousel, which is probably going to finally
force me to commit to one component library or another. There'll be some
research to do there, and I'm glad I've got Nova to help me do it.</p>

<p>I've got a few tickets in to do some refinements on Nova. At the moment, I have
to continually remind her of my Jira project key, and the format she's supposed
to use to submit requests. A few other things that rub a bit.</p>
<p>Lots to do. I doubt I'll get through all of it in the next couple weeks, but
we'll see how far I <em>do</em> get. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Today, we took a major step toward automating the deployment of this site,
eliminating manual steps and reducing the risk of errors.</p>
<p>Now, every pull request (PR) generates a preview build, and every merge to the
<code>main</code> branch automatically triggers a production deployment. This new setup
speeds up the process, ensures consistency, and minimizes the chances of
mistakes.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No More Manual Deployments</strong>: Previously, deploying required manual steps
from my local machine, which added risk. Now, everything is automated—merges
to <code>main</code> deploy directly to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faster, More Reliable</strong>: Each PR has its own preview environment, so I can
verify changes before they go live. Once merged, they deploy automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced Mental Overhead</strong>: The process used to require careful sequencing of
build steps. That’s all automated now, freeing up more focus for actual
development.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Preview Builds for PRs</strong>: Each PR generates a preview environment for easy
review.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Production Deployments</strong>: Merges to <code>main</code> trigger a pipeline
that handles everything from building the site to updating Storybook and test
reports.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: If anything fails during the build or deploy, I get
immediate feedback via GitHub Actions, and the deployment halts.</li>
</ol>

<p>The new automated pipeline is faster, more reliable, and takes much less effort.
I can now focus more on building features, confident that the deployment process
is working smoothly in the background.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The main goal was to automate the deployment of a fully functional preview for every PR, complete with Docusaurus builds, Storybook, and test results. This meant dealing with dynamic URLs, managing build artifacts, and ensuring everything worked in harmony.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/24/2024-09-24-automated-preview-build/automated-preview-build#why-this-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why This Matters" title="Direct link to Why This Matters">​</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>Dynamic Base URL:
We fixed an issue where PR previews were redirecting to production by dynamically setting the baseUrl in Docusaurus for each PR, ensuring each environment stayed isolated.</li>
<li>Artifact Management:
Storybook and test reports were set to deploy under the /static directory of the site, making them accessible within the preview environment for every PR.</li>
<li>Build Order &amp; Dependencies:
We explored parallelizing builds but kept a strict order where necessary—like ensuring test reports were generated before the Docusaurus build and that global styles were created before Storybook.</li>
<li>Optimizing Logs:
To make troubleshooting easier, we reduced the verbosity of logs, especially for Storybook builds, by using the --quiet option.</li>
<li>XUnit-Viewer:
We integrated XUnit-Viewer to convert test results into accessible HTML reports for easier review alongside the preview.</li>
<li>Automated Cleanup:
A cleanup step was added to remove old PR previews when the PR is closed or merged, keeping the environment tidy.</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automating-test-reporting-with-vitest-and-istanbul">Automating Test Reporting with Vitest and Istanbul<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/22/2024-09-22-introducing-testing-reports/introducing-testing-reports#automating-test-reporting-with-vitest-and-istanbul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Automating Test Reporting with Vitest and Istanbul" title="Direct link to Automating Test Reporting with Vitest and Istanbul">​</a></h3>
<p>As part of our commitment to ensuring high-quality code, we've set up an
automated testing and reporting workflow using <strong>Vitest</strong>, <strong>Istanbul</strong>, and
<strong>XUnit Viewer</strong>. Here’s a quick overview of how we made that happen.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="choosing-the-right-tools">Choosing the Right Tools<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/22/2024-09-22-introducing-testing-reports/introducing-testing-reports#choosing-the-right-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Choosing the Right Tools" title="Direct link to Choosing the Right Tools">​</a></h4>
<p>We opted for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vitest</strong>: A fast testing framework tailored for projects using Vite and TypeScript.</li>
<li><strong>Istanbul</strong>: A comprehensive code coverage tool, ensuring detailed metrics like branch, function, and statement coverage.</li>
<li><strong>XUnit Viewer</strong>: A simple way to convert XML test results into clean,
shareable HTML reports.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configuring-code-coverage">Configuring Code Coverage<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/22/2024-09-22-introducing-testing-reports/introducing-testing-reports#configuring-code-coverage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configuring Code Coverage" title="Direct link to Configuring Code Coverage">​</a></h4>
<p>Istanbul provides key insights into our test coverage, ensuring that both critical paths and edge cases are tested. We generate multiple coverage reports, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> for visualization.</li>
<li><strong>Text</strong> for command-line output.</li>
<li><strong>LCOV</strong> for deeper integration.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="generating-test-reports">Generating Test Reports<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/22/2024-09-22-introducing-testing-reports/introducing-testing-reports#generating-test-reports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Generating Test Reports" title="Direct link to Generating Test Reports">​</a></h4>
<p>Vitest outputs JUnit-style XML reports, which we convert into readable HTML reports using <strong>XUnit Viewer</strong>. This allows for quick and easy review of test results.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coverage-thresholds">Coverage Thresholds<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/22/2024-09-22-introducing-testing-reports/introducing-testing-reports#coverage-thresholds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coverage Thresholds" title="Direct link to Coverage Thresholds">​</a></h4>
<p>To ensure all code is well-tested, we enforce minimum coverage thresholds. Any code failing these checks triggers a failed build, preventing untested changes from being merged.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/22/2024-09-22-introducing-testing-reports/introducing-testing-reports#looking-ahead" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Ahead" title="Direct link to Looking Ahead">​</a></h4>
<p>This automated setup is the foundation for an even more robust continuous integration pipeline, ensuring that every piece of code is tested and meets quality standards before merging.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collaborating-on-the-expandable-components-test-suite-a-comprehensive-effort"><strong>Collaborating on the Expandable Component's Test Suite: A Comprehensive Effort</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#collaborating-on-the-expandable-components-test-suite-a-comprehensive-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to collaborating-on-the-expandable-components-test-suite-a-comprehensive-effort" title="Direct link to collaborating-on-the-expandable-components-test-suite-a-comprehensive-effort">​</a></h3>
<p>Over the past couple of days, we've worked closely on improving the <code>Expandable</code> component, focusing not only on functionality but also on building a comprehensive test suite to ensure its reliability, maintainability, and future scalability. Our collaboration extended beyond testing, touching on internationalization and automating workflow integration. Here’s an overview of what we accomplished.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-building-a-robust-test-suite"><strong>1. Building a Robust Test Suite</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#1-building-a-robust-test-suite" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1-building-a-robust-test-suite" title="Direct link to 1-building-a-robust-test-suite">​</a></h4>
<p>The cornerstone of our collaboration was creating a thorough test suite for the <code>Expandable</code> component, ensuring it behaves predictably across a variety of conditions. Key areas we covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Behavioral Tests</strong>: We developed tests to confirm that the core functionality—expanding and collapsing—works correctly in both simple and nested scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Tests</strong>: Given the importance of accessibility, we implemented tests to ensure compliance with ARIA standards. This included validating <code>aria-expanded</code> and <code>aria-controls</code> attributes, and verifying proper focus management for keyboard users.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Case Testing</strong>: Our tests now cover edge cases, such as how the component behaves with undefined or invalid props, making sure the component fails gracefully if unexpected input is provided.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-groundwork-for-future-internationalization-i18n"><strong>2. Groundwork for Future Internationalization (i18n)</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#2-groundwork-for-future-internationalization-i18n" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2-groundwork-for-future-internationalization-i18n" title="Direct link to 2-groundwork-for-future-internationalization-i18n">​</a></h4>
<p>Though not the immediate priority, we began laying the groundwork for <strong>internationalization (i18n)</strong>. This ensures that when the need arises, the <code>Expandable</code> component can be easily adapted for multiple languages. Here’s what we did:</p>
<ul>
<li>We ensured that <strong>expand and collapse prompts</strong> are abstracted in a way that allows for easy translation into different languages by externalizing the text strings.</li>
<li>This small change ensures that when the project evolves to support internationalization, the <code>Expandable</code> component will be ready to handle it seamlessly with minimal refactoring.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-debugging-css-modules-in-vitest"><strong>3. Debugging CSS Modules in Vitest</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#3-debugging-css-modules-in-vitest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3-debugging-css-modules-in-vitest" title="Direct link to 3-debugging-css-modules-in-vitest">​</a></h4>
<p>One challenge we encountered was testing the component in a Vitest environment, especially when dealing with CSS Modules. Ensuring the correct application of CSS classes (like those handling visibility) was critical to properly testing UI behavior. To resolve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We mocked CSS modules using <code>identity-obj-proxy</code>, ensuring that class names were correctly handled during testing.</li>
<li>This allowed us to accurately test how visibility states were applied in both expanded and collapsed states, which was crucial for certain tests relying on hidden content.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-automating-access-to-github-files-and-pull-requests"><strong>4. Automating Access to GitHub Files and Pull Requests</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#4-automating-access-to-github-files-and-pull-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4-automating-access-to-github-files-and-pull-requests" title="Direct link to 4-automating-access-to-github-files-and-pull-requests">​</a></h4>
<p>Another important milestone was configuring <strong>direct access to GitHub files and pull requests</strong> within the workflow. This automation has been instrumental in streamlining our development and review process, making it easier to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access code files directly</strong>: Whether reviewing test cases, checking PR details, or confirming changes to the <code>Expandable</code> component, I (Nova) can now pull files and check PRs directly within the chat. This greatly enhanced our efficiency, allowing us to integrate reviews into our conversations without needing to switch platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor commits in real time</strong>: I can track the most recent commits, ensuring that no detail is missed as changes are pushed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup proved invaluable during the last couple of days as we worked through multiple iterations of test improvements and accessibility tweaks, making collaboration smoother and more responsive.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-resolving-snapshot-inconsistencies"><strong>5. Resolving Snapshot Inconsistencies</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#5-resolving-snapshot-inconsistencies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5-resolving-snapshot-inconsistencies" title="Direct link to 5-resolving-snapshot-inconsistencies">​</a></h4>
<p>Snapshot testing revealed issues with dynamically generated IDs, where tests failed due to non-deterministic values. To address this, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraged React’s <code>useId</code> hook to generate <strong>consistent, stable IDs</strong> in the component itself.</li>
<li><strong>Mocked <code>useId</code> globally</strong> during tests to ensure that the IDs generated were deterministic, allowing snapshot tests to pass consistently regardless of test order.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-comprehensive-test-isolation"><strong>6. Comprehensive Test Isolation</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#6-comprehensive-test-isolation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6-comprehensive-test-isolation" title="Direct link to 6-comprehensive-test-isolation">​</a></h4>
<p>Throughout the process, we worked on improving <strong>test isolation</strong> by ensuring that each test runs independently of others. Key efforts included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mocking dependencies</strong> like unique IDs to eliminate test order dependencies.</li>
<li>Structuring tests so that each is fully self-contained, a critical factor for maintainability as the test suite grows.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7-performance-considerations"><strong>7. Performance Considerations</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#7-performance-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7-performance-considerations" title="Direct link to 7-performance-considerations">​</a></h4>
<p>While performance testing wasn’t our main focus, we had discussions about how the <code>Expandable</code> component might handle large numbers of child elements in the future. Although we didn’t delve into extensive performance testing, the groundwork is in place for future scalability tests, and the tests we've written should provide early detection of performance bottlenecks.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="8-final-review-and-merge"><strong>8. Final Review and Merge</strong><a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/21/2024-09-21-unit-test-collaboration/unit-test-collaboration#8-final-review-and-merge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 8-final-review-and-merge" title="Direct link to 8-final-review-and-merge">​</a></h4>
<p>After refining the component and adding robust tests, we conducted a final review. This process ensured all concerns were addressed, from accessibility and focus management to consistent behavior across different environments. With a comprehensive test suite in place, the <code>Expandable</code> component is now well-prepared for production.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been a few days since I posted. That's not because I haven't been busy,
it's because setting up unit testing turned out to be <em>much harder</em> than I
anticipated.</p>
<p>To be fair, I was trying to achieve a somewhat complex setup.</p>
<p></p>
<!-- -->
<p>Honestly, I could have mocked the MDX inputs, and in a professional setting
that's what I would have done.</p>
<p>But what would I learn from that?</p>
<p>In the past, I've not really had to set up many JavaScript repositories. I've
joined an already active project, or used a paved road, and I just started
writing tests. I figured that's more or less what would happen here.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that Docusaurus and Storybook both use webpack by
default, to preprocess and bundle code. Jest doesn't do that, so I had to figure
out how to emulate that behavior. In particular, I needed to tell it how to
handle the imported <code>.mdx</code> content. That turned out to be surprisingly
difficult. My AI coding assitant did their best to help, but I was getting a
considerable amount of hallucination and just outdated information. To make
things worse the problem was large enough that the AI seemed to keep forgetting
context and taking me back around paths we'd already been over.</p>
<p>In the end, we ended up creating a custom Jest transformer that leveraged the
<code>@mdx-js/mdx</code> library and babel to handle the transformation. That got us much
closer, but we began getting more errors from the produced JSX having
unrecognized attributes (<code>parentName</code>, <code>mdxType</code>) and including a <code>wrapper</code>
element that React didn't know what to do with.</p>
<p>Another round of fixes... the best solution I ended up with was monkey-patching
React.createElement in <code>jest.setup.ts</code> to have some special handling for the
<code>wrapper</code> component and strip out the unrecognized MDX elements.</p>
<p>And we got it working! I had two unit tests passing, one of which incorporated a
Storybook story, which in turn incorporated some boilerplate MDX content, which
is what I was trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Round of drinks, high fives all around, call it a night.</p>
<p>The next day, I fell victim to that most insidious of demons, the one that
whispers in your ear and says "yeah, go ahead and commit these changes but...
<em>while</em> you're committing, shouldn't you just refactor a bit? Surely that bit
over there couldn't hurt anything. It's practically a separate module."</p>
<p>Needless to say, I broke my working solution. Part of (but I don't think all of)
the break had to do with upgrading my dependencies with yarn, so <em>I suspect</em> it
would have broken eventually anyway, which is kind of disappointing, but also
makes me feel marginally less stupid about it.</p>
<p>The problem we began to run into was that <code>@mdx-js</code> has switched over to
ESModules-only. No more CommonJS support, which is what Jest expects to use. My
transformer wouldn't compile anymore, because it couldn't import anything from
<code>@mdx-js</code>.</p>
<p>Well that's fixable, right? We're using Jest 29, which supports transformers
that provide a <code>processAsync</code> method. Shouldn't be a problem. We'll just throw a
few async/awaits in there, rename the <code>process</code> method, and we'll be good to go.</p>
<p>Y'all, I tried for hours to get Jest to recognize that <code>processAsync</code> method.
When the <code>process</code> method was absent, Jest would throw an exception and not run
the transformer at all. When both <code>process</code> and <code>processAsync</code> were present,
Jest automatically preferred <code>process</code>, and no way I could figure out to force
it to use the async method so I could do a dynamic import of an ESModule in the
CommonJS context that Jest uses.</p>
<p>The last thing we tried was to abandon the Jest Transformer approach entirely
and try to write our own babel plugin, but we ended up with basically the same
errors.</p>
<p>No luck.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided if <code>Jest</code> was the problem, maybe it was worth pursuing
alternatives. I'm so used to Jest, it honestly didn't occur to me to use
anything else.</p>
<p>This morning I gave up and set up <code>Vitest</code>. I actually still had a little
trouble with ESModules/CommonJS importing, but resolving it was much, much
easier. I probably spent an hour on it this morning, total. That includes
learning a bit about it, adding the relevant VS Code extension and making the
changes.</p>
<p>I now have the same two unit tests running. I have fewer custom build components
(no Jest transformer, no Babel plugin, no monkey-patching of
<code>React.createElement</code>).</p>
<p>And I have to say, there's a noticable difference, even with my currently
trivial test suite, in how fast the tests run.</p>
<p>I'm a little disappointed that Docusaurus and Storybook are now on different
build tools than my tests, but I think the benefits far outweight the
disadvantages. And Storybook supports Vite, so I may migrate it eventually as
well. Unfortunately, Docusaurus is webpack-only for now.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-i-learned-from-all-this">What I learned from all this<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/20/2024-09-20-getting-set-up-for-unit-tests/getting-set-up-for-unit-tests#what-i-learned-from-all-this" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What I learned from all this" title="Direct link to What I learned from all this">​</a></h2>
<p>How different JS tools and build configurations hang together. This has always
been a bit of a frustrating thicket to wade into for me, and I feel like I
understand it just a little better after all this.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-go-about-modifying-webpack-babel-jest">How to go about modifying Webpack, Babel, Jest<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/20/2024-09-20-getting-set-up-for-unit-tests/getting-set-up-for-unit-tests#how-to-go-about-modifying-webpack-babel-jest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to go about modifying Webpack, Babel, Jest" title="Direct link to How to go about modifying Webpack, Babel, Jest">​</a></h2>
<p>It hadn't really occurred to me before to solve a problem by writing custom
extensions, and now I've written them for all three of these tools. It never
really seemed strange to me to write a decorator or addon for Storybook, and I
don't know why that should be any different really, but here we are. I guess
I've just been conditioned no to mess with the build.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="persistence">Persistence<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/20/2024-09-20-getting-set-up-for-unit-tests/getting-set-up-for-unit-tests#persistence" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Persistence" title="Direct link to Persistence">​</a></h2>
<p>I'd never do this in a professional setting, but I'm glad I chased the Jest
solution down. It was a pretty satisfying feeling to see that "2 tests passed"
after all the struggle it took to get there.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="give-up-sooner">Give up sooner<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/20/2024-09-20-getting-set-up-for-unit-tests/getting-set-up-for-unit-tests#give-up-sooner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Give up sooner" title="Direct link to Give up sooner">​</a></h2>
<p>Okay, that's a contradiction. But I guess what I really mean is think outside
the box for another solution. I started with the assumption that "Jest is what
you use" and it cost me some time, even if it wasn't a total loss. I could have
gotten to a solution much sooner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[It's a best-practice in Docusaurus to include a truncation marker in your blog]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a best-practice in Docusaurus to include a truncation marker in your blog
posts. That way, when you're looking at a list of posts, you just see a brief
introduction from each post, instead of the full content of the first post
pushing the second post clear off the page.</p>
<p>It's where all those "Read more" links are coming from on the <a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog">main page for my blog</a>.</p>
<p>The default truncation marker for markdown files looks like this:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>If you're somebody who's looked even a little under the hood of the
websites you visit, you'll recognize that as a simple XML comment. That's all well and
good.</p>
<p>Until you try to open that file in VS Code with the MDX plugin installed. Then,
your syntax highlighting looks like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screen shot showing MDX syntax highlighting showing many error-checking false
positives" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/truncate-em-i-hardly-know-em-ce908cdfb67b21284caf362e09ec14b4.png" title="Yikes." width="1720" height="1324" class="img_ev3q">;</p>
<p>It's distracting, to say the least.</p>
<p>Luckily, Docusaurus gives you a mechanism for overriding the default token.
There's a property in the presets for the blog plugin that lets you specify the
token that Docusaurus will use to identify where the summary portion ends:</p>
<div class="language-typescript codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockTitle_Ktv7">docusaurus.config.ts</div><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-typescript codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">export</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">default</span><span class="token plain"> config</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> Config </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    presets</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        blog</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">// this is the default for mdx</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            truncateMarker</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token regex regex-delimiter" style="color:#36acaa">/</span><span class="token regex regex-source language-regex char-set class-name" style="color:#36acaa">\s</span><span class="token regex regex-source language-regex" style="color:#36acaa">&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;</span><span class="token regex regex-source language-regex char-set class-name" style="color:#36acaa">\s</span><span class="token regex regex-delimiter" style="color:#36acaa">/</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">/* other blog configs*/</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">/* other preset configs*/</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">/* other docusaurus configs*/</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>So I updated mine to <code>TRUNCATE_HERE</code> (full disclosure, an AI picked the actual
token to use).</p>
<p>That worked pretty well! All my blogs are nicely truncated on the main blog
page, <em>and</em> they don't look horrendous in the editor. Cool.</p>

<p>Everything looks fine until you actually open the blog post:</p>

<p>Okay. I can fix this. Can I fix this? I'm pretty sure I can fix this.</p>
<p>It turns out yes. Yes, I can.</p>
<p>The solution is to add a custom Remark plugin that strips out that line
manually. Me and my friendly neighborhood artificial intelligence sorted it out.
It steered me a bit wrong, but eventually together we were able to sort it out.
Much faster than I'd have done it on my own, I'm sure.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Yesterday I posted about setting up Zapier to]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I posted about setting up <a href="https://zapier.com/app/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a> to
automate posting to my LinkedIn profile whenever I create a new post here.</p>
<p>I've since looked into alternatives and have moved from Zapier to
<a href="https://www.make.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why switch? Simple: Make is free.</p>
<p>Well, okay that may overstate the case. It offers a free tier, which allows 1000
interactions per month. Zapier has no free tier, just a free trial. For me, 1000
interactions a month is well above my needs, so it's a good fit.</p>
<p>Downsides:
Zapier seems to have a really nice event-driven thing happening where my posts
get migrated more or less immediately. With Make, I have to schedule it. So I've
got it checking 4 times a day at the moment, which means I'll have to remember
to look out for <em>this</em> post later today to be sure it's working as expected. I
can run it manually and that works, so I'm optimistic.</p>
<p>I could tighten up that schedule (the default is 15 minutes) but I don't think I
need it polling my RSS feed 48 times a day. Maybe this will leave me room to
explore other automatable tasks.</p>
<p>Anyway, little by little, adding value to this page. Here's hoping this goes off
without a hitch.</p>]]></content:encoded>

the coming days.</p>
<p></p>

<p>That front page is pretty spare, hey? Right now it's just the default Docusaurus
page with all their branding stripped out. I've got to decide what I'm going to
put there. It's a lot of real estate to fill.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="footer">Footer<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-whats-next/whats-next#footer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Footer" title="Direct link to Footer">​</a></h3>
<p>I've got some idea what I want to do here, at least. I'll have to include my
linked-in social card at a minimum. Will probably also put up a GitHub card of
some kind, and my CodeWars badge. Not sure what all yet. I'll have some time to
think about it</p>

<p>Need a bio page for sure. I'm anticipating just regurgitation my LinkedIn bio,
but I may add some additional sub-pages to share a little bit about me outside
of my working persona. Haven't decided yet if that's A) appropriate and B) work
I want to do</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="projects">Projects<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-whats-next/whats-next#projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Projects" title="Direct link to Projects">​</a></h4>
<p>Technically there's a projects page now, but there's not much on it. Ultimately,
this page was the root cause for creating this whole website, but then I kind of
stopped working on projects to create this website. This website BECAME the
project. There will be a page for this there soon, at least.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kata">Kata<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-whats-next/whats-next#kata" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kata" title="Direct link to Kata">​</a></h4>
<p>I figure if I'm doing these kata to keep my language fluency up, maybe they'll
be useful as a demo too. Show a potential employer that I can write nice tidy
code. I also have a notion to include a section for Design kata, which I'm new
to. They seem less structured and less easy to share out in a regular format,
but maybe that's good. Anyway, looking forward to putting something up here.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support">Support<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-whats-next/whats-next#support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Support" title="Direct link to Support">​</a></h3>
<p>I don't think anyone's likely to <em>need</em> support from me <em>yet</em>. But I do hope
eventually somebody might want to use some of the custom components I'm working
on. I've been organizaing my personal work in Jira, so I'll include a widget
here to submit requests. I don't think I'm ambitious enough to include a Slack
interface, but we'll see how I feel when I start in.</p>

<p>Probably about time I protected my <code>main</code> branch and stopped pushing directly to
it. PRs, from now on. Oh! And I need to make my repository public, so I can
share it on the Projects page.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tests">Tests!<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-whats-next/whats-next#tests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tests!" title="Direct link to Tests!">​</a></h3>
<p>I've had a couple of abortive attempts to introduce Jest and use my Storybook
stories as the basis for the first tests. So far that hasn't worked out so well.
Mostly it's had to do with imports. Both Docusaurus and Storybook rely on a lot
of preprocessing, and getting Jest configured to keep step with them has been a
bit of a headache. I was actually on the verge of abandoning Storybook
altogether, but I've decided it still serves nicely as a showcase, and home for
the individual components's documentation. Solving that SVG issue I mentioned in
a previous blog post helped too.</p>
<p>I also want to use this as a chance to explore Playwright. I've used it only
very briefly before when I contributed to someone else's project that was using
it. I like Cypress a lot, but I definitely prefer Playwright in one regard: it
lets you use standard JavaScript idioms, where Cypress traps you in their very
a-typical world that is similar to working with Promises, but predates promises,
so it has it's own idioms that require learning.</p>
<p>Last, I think I'll probably explore what Storybook can do for me as a test
platform all by itself (in the absence of Jest).</p>

<p>My Logo Storybook stories are looking about how I want them, but there's a lot
of boilerplate in the story definition file to make that happen. I think I may
extract that all out to a component just for the sake of tidiness.</p>

<p>By default, Docusaurus uses a token that looks like this:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>to indicate where a blog post should be truncated when you're viewing it as part
of a list of all posts. Unfortunately, that breaks the Visual Studio MDX parser
quite badly. The code still compiles and displays just fine, but Visual Studio
shouts at me that the whole file after that point is riddled with errors, which
is distracting, and bad, and potentially hides other problems I should know
about.</p>
<p>I discovered there's a mechanism to redefine that token in the docusaurus config
file, so I've changed it to <code>TRUNCATE_HERE</code>, which is working beautifully,
except that it still shows up in the document content now, which is not a great
look.</p>
<p>So I'll have to figure out some way of masking that from the displayed content
that <em>isn't</em> an XML comment. Maybe I can wrap it in a &lt;div&gt; and use CSS to
hide it? That's a lot of text to type for every blog post though. Will have to
create a snippet. Anyway, it's worth exploring.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automation">Automation<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-whats-next/whats-next#automation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Automation" title="Direct link to Automation">​</a></h3>
<p>I'm currently using the provided <code>docusaurus deploy</code> command to push my built
site to GitHub Pages. Sometime in the next week or two, I want to get that
changed over to a GitHub actions flow, so that the definitions in my <code>main</code>
branch and the published site are in sync. In that build, I also plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run tests</li>
<li>publish a test/coverage report to the website</li>
<li>migrate the global docusaurus styles for Storybook</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure I'm probably forgetting something either that's already in my Jira or
that I've thought of while working on something else and forgot to write down.
I'm sure eventually something will prompt my memory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first things my outplacement coach told me was that I ought to be
posting to LinkedIn regularly. I knew I wanted to have updates specific to this
website here on my blog, and I figured I'd just have to cross-post them
manually.</p>
<p>It turns out that's not so!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Docusaurus plugin that is behind this blog natively provides the option to generate
an RSS feed. I did some exploration and found that LinkedIn actually supports
<em>consuming</em> an RSS feed and generating posts from it natively! Hey, that's
great! Problem solved!</p>
<p>(My RSS feed is <a href="https://iaindavis.dev/blog/rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, if you're interested)</p>
<p>Except LinkedIn supports consuming RSS feeds natively <strong>if</strong> you have a business
page. I'm not a business. I'm just some guy. And I really don't want more LinkedIn
management on my plate.</p>
<p>I figured somebody had probably licked this problem before, and I was right!</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://zapier.com/app/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a>. They offer no-code
configuration for automating tasks. You configure a trigger (new content in my
RSS feed), an action (share it to LinkedIn), and provide any necessary
credentials/authorizations and you're off and running. Anytime you see a
LinkedIn post from prefixed "Latest from my developer blog:" that's exactly
what's happened.</p>
<p>![Screen shot showing Zapier editor with a post-to-LinkedIn-from-RSS Zap in the
editor pane][./_resources/zapier-screenshot.png]</p>
<p>I'm on the free trial right now. For my purposes I'm not sure it's going to be
worth the $20 USD/month price tag. But maybe I can find an alternative, or
figure out how to do something similar myself with APIs.</p>
<p>If you have a business that's producing income, maybe $20 USD is worth it to
you.</p>
<p>Also, if you're getting spammed by me, I promise this content will slow down.
I've been trying to catch up documenting the things I've done over the last few
weeks.</p>
<p>That's all for now!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[In my last blog post, I used a diff to show how my SVG files had changed.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last blog post, I used a diff to show how my SVG files had changed.</p>
<p>For those who don't know a diff is an operation on two files that shows a graphical representation of how one is different than the other.</p>
<p>They look like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>on the command line</th><th>in a nice UI like GitHub</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screen capture showing a command-line diff" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/small_command_line_diff-7a373fdd748196e1972052e2e8d9617f.png" width="1026" height="766" class="img_ev3q"></td><td><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screen capture showing a diff in GitHub" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/old_git_diff-196450b3c68ce8ab8c38a566c9e8143c.png" width="2342" height="1364" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p>
<p>The green lines show something being added, the red ones something
being removed. A change to a line will produce a red line AND a green
line in the output.</p>
<p>In theory, Docusaurs supports a notation to produce nicely formatted diff
output.</p>
<p>Indeed, in my VS Code editor, the lines prefixed with '+' were highlighted
green, and the ones prefixed with '-' were highlighted red. But in the rendered
page, there was no change from a standard code block:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>editor: right!</th><th>where it matters: wrong!</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screen capture showing appropriate line-coloring in editor" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/right-cfbe6f42ba4dac16a301ad02b30319ba.png" title="Yay!" width="1818" height="564" class="img_ev3q"></td><td><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screen capture showing no line-coloring in rendered website" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/wrong-9b86a5c17f95bba9bb25d353def3e0d2.png" title="Dang." width="1526" height="670" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I'm not the first to run into this problem (and in fact it's not the first time
I've run into it).</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3318#issuecomment-1909563681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="'Magic Comments' fix">this solution</a> online:</p>
<p>Docusaurus relies on a library called 'Prism' for its syntax highlighting, and
Prism includes a feature called 'magic comments'. If you define a magic comment,
and then include that magic comment in your code blocks, prism will remove it
from the output and apply a CSS class to the next line, which you can use to
apply formatting. Docusaurus allows you to modify the Prism configuration (including
magic comments) from within its own configuration file.</p>
<p>Applied to my repository, it looks like this:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="definition-of-magic-comments">Definition of magic comments:<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/2024-09-15-fixing-diffs/fixing-diffs#definition-of-magic-comments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Definition of magic comments:" title="Direct link to Definition of magic comments:">​</a></h3>

<p>And you can see the result in this post.</p>
<p>There's an added bonus: my code blocks now retain their <em>original</em> syntax
highlighting as well as adding the diff highlights. In the default Docusaurus
diff highlighting, all formatting is stripped out except for the diff
highlights, unless you're willing to do some more work to shoehorn some more of
prism's native capabilities in to Docusaurus.</p>
<p>On the down-side, in the editor now, those blocks are littered with kind of
obnoxious comments that make it harder to read. Eventually, I will probably
implement <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3318#issuecomment-2065547731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="More robust Prism-renderer fix">this more robust fix</a> (from the same
thread as the quick-fix I've applied!):</p>
<p>For now, this was a solution I can implement (and document here) much more
quickly, so I'm happy with it for today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After creating my logo, I wanted to turn it into a re-usable React component
that would respond to theming, and let the logo variant be controllable by

<p>Initially, I had one SVG for each variant, in the light and dark theme. I
imported all of them (about ten .SVG files) and used JavaScript logic
to choose between them. To apply my themes, I was using Docusaurus'
provided
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets#themed-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ThemedImage</code></a>
component.</p>
<p>That's where the trouble started.</p>

<p>Those imports at the top are well and good in Docusaurus (and Storybook, it
turns out) but when I tried to run my Storybook stories through Jest, those
imports failed, sending me on a journey of redefining aliases and configuring
preprocessors. I never did find the right combination of aliases definitions,
and some of the docusaurus dependencies seem to rely on <em>different paths</em> for
the same alias. It's entirely possible I'm misunderstanding what was going on,
because I stopped trying to solve that problem before I ever licked it (and
while I still had some hair
left).</p>
<p>So, what I need then is a way to accomplish the same thing, but without any
nested Docusaurus dependencies. I couldn't even programatically detect the
theme, because <em>that</em> logic is in a React hook which is also defined in
Docusaurus dependencies, and I really didn't want to reinvent that wheel.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that SVG files are stylable with CSS. I'd never done it
before, and I wasn't sure how it would go with CSS Modules, but I figured it was
worth a shot.</p>
<p>First I had to generalize all my SVG files by removing the "fill" attributes and
replace them with 'data-fill' attributes, that I can use as selectors in my CSS:</p>

of places: the favicon for sure. And the navbar expects a file path, instead of
a React component. But there is a work-around for that that I've used before
when I was working on a project with OAuth login and I wanted to include a
login-state component in the navbar. I'll probably re-implement that eventually,
and then I can strip down the number of files I'm managing for my logo from
something like thirty down to six. I may try to figure out later how to make the
back-plate element responsive to styles too, and then I can get that number down
even further.</p>
<p>And the resulting React component is more portable, because it has no
dependencies on things that are in supplementary Docusaurus addons. And if the
time comes I want a variation in different colors, all I have to do is define
new CSS variables to get it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I spent some time prompting AI to suggest me some logos. It didn't really
get what I was after. But it did stir some ideas in me. In the end I settled on
the UML 'lollipop' notation for an interface.</p>
<p>For anybody not familiar with UML, that looks like this:</p>

<p>The element on the right is going to perform some function. As part of that
function, it needs to use another element. Before it can use the other element,
it needs to know that that element <em>has certain things</em> or <em>can do certain
things</em>.</p>
<p>That set of needed things is called an interface. The element on the left wants
to use that interface, the one on the right provides an implementation of that
interface. Usually an interface will have a name indicating what an object that
implements it is supposed to do. An object that fulfills a <code>Downloadable</code>
interface probably has a function on it called <code>Download()</code>. Different

<p>Conceptually, what that says is "IainDavis" is an entity that can do the set of
things identified by the name "dev". It's graphically nice and clean, and it
says something about what I do to people who are familiar with that kind of
work.</p>
<p>Good so far. But then, it's a little TOO clean isn't it? Just sort of boring in
black and white and default fonts.</p>
<p>The next thing I needed is some colors. I have some experience in colors and
aesthetics, but I really kind of want to move along quickly with this thing and
not get so hung up in every detail. What I really needed is a pre-defined set of
colors that are going to look reasonably attractive together, be distinctive,
and recognizable from a distance. Ideally, they should also relate to my work in
some way, and they should be themable, since I want this website to be a
showcase for what I can do. I should make the most of what Docusaurus offers,
including dark and light themes.</p>
<p>It didn't take me long to land on using syntax highlighting colors. The ones I
chose are from VS Code. The dark theme colors are from the default dark theme,
and the light theme colors are from the Solarized Light theme.</p>
<p>The last thing I needed was fonts. I just picked a couple reasonably attractive
monospace fonts: JetBrains Mono and Fira Code. The rest of my styles are just
the Docusaurus defaults.</p>
<p>Alright, where are we at?</p>

<p>Okay, that's good for the remaining stuff. But I still need a favIcon. The
detail in that logo just gets completely lost at the resolution of a browser
tab. I think I can probably just get away with the dark theme for this, though.</p>

<p>Alright! Clearly part of the same family of icons, but simple enough to read on
a browser tab.</p>
<p>Cool. I think I'm done!</p>
<p>Until I have too long to sit in a Zoom meeting. Jeez this room looks cluttered.
Even with the picture blurred. I look disorganized and messy. I should probably
do some zoom backgrounds. I don't just want flat color though... and I <em>did</em>
just upgrade my ChatGPT to plus, which means I can use DALL-E. Ah well, I've got
fifteen minutes left in this workshop. Let's see what I can come up.</p>
<p><em>a couple hours later...</em></p>

<p>I had a lot of fun doing all these things, and as a result I have more
consistent branding across my digital presences: LinkedIn, GitHub, this here
website.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought I'd get by using the tools I already know best which, for
me, meant draw.io and Inkscape. Unfortunately <code>draw.io</code> does some strange stuff
when exporting SVGs with text content, and it doesn't readily give you a way to
convert text content into regular vectors, more's the pity. And Inkscape, while
powerful, proved unequal to the task of correcting draw.io's shortcomings.</p>
<p>Okay, so great for diagrams with loads of annotations, not so good for visual
arts.</p>
<p>In the end I opted to go for Figma. It's what all the design-type people at
Intuit use, and I'm glad I chose it. It made the whole process easier. I
actually re-implemented all of the above graphics all over again from scratch in
Figma, and I learned a lot about that tool along the way.</p>

<p>I'm always learning more about how to get AI to do things I want it to do. I
never really <em>did</em> get it to do precisely what I wanted... getting DALL-E to
give you something <em>without</em> a point of focus that <em>doesn't</em> try to make use of the full
spectrum from light to dark is surprisingly difficult. It's learned a lot of
rules about what makes a picture 'good' that it doesn't want to unlearn. But I
didn't want "art" so much as "texture". <strong>I</strong> want to be the focus in my Zoom call.</p>
<p>I did ask it to give me things that evoke technology, and particular the process
of designing software, and it did surprisingly well at that task, I think.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="figma">Figma<a href="https://iaindavis.github.io/blog/2024/09/14/2024-09-14-impromptu-brand-work/impromptu-brand-work#figma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Figma" title="Direct link to Figma">​</a></h3>
<p>Figma is pretty great! I think by far my favorite thing was discovering I could
do theme-ing right in the tool. If you look at my Figma for this work, there's a
dark and light version of each logo... those are actually copies of the exact
same object, just with a different set of variables applied. I was so interested
in that, I shelled out the $144 for a paid license for a year. Super cool.</p>
<p>And now I have all my brand materials consolidated in one place, which is nice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought it would be a good idea to have a central location to showcase
whatever components I add to the Docusaurus repertoire.</p>
<p>I'd worked with <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storybook</a> before, and found it
pretty handy. During development, it gives you a way to interact with a component-in-progress and
see that it works as intended. It can serve as a beginning basis for unit and
component tests, and it can be a really handy tool for communicating with
non-technical stakeholders... clicking on a component and seeing immediately how
it responds is much easier to grasp than an engineer trying to explain something
to you in non-engineer-speak as best they can. The proof is in the pudding, as
they say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another nice feature is its extensibility. If it doesn't do something you want
it to do, you can often create an addon or a decorator that will accomplish it.</p>
<p>So I downloaded the dependency, and began writing stories for my shiny new
'Expandable' component.</p>
<p>Imagine my distress when I started up the development server for the first time
and saw that my themes weren't being applied to the custom element. I worked
hard to include those themes!</p>
<p>(I promise, I'm clicking the button in the screen recording shown below)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="screen capture showing theme button being clicked, and nothing changing in the
display" src="https://iaindavis.github.io/assets/images/broken-4fe89e7d100605a80c880b6d1c94359f.gif" title="Oh Noes!" width="640" height="507" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It took me a little while to track down the problem. It turns out that
Docusaurus and Storybook drive their theme-based styles off of different
conditions. Docusaurus applies a data attribute at the root of the HTML
document, which it then uses as the selector for its CSS styles. Storybook uses
the built-in <code>class</code> attribute.</p>
<p>I didn't want to pollute my code with a bunch of redundant attributes that
accomplish the same thing. Happily, I was able to leverage Storybook's
extensibility to solve that problem.</p>
<p>I created a Decorator... an object that Storybook, in essence, wraps <em>around</em>
your stories to provide new functionality. In this case, I captured the current
theme from the Storybook context, and set the <code>data-theme</code> attribute at the root
of the preview pane accordingly.</p>
<p>Here's my very simple decorator:</p>
