Yesterday I posted about setting up [Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/home) to
automate posting to my LinkedIn profile whenever I create a new post here.

I've since looked into alternatives and have moved from Zapier to
[Make](https://www.make.com/en).

Why switch? Simple: It's free.

Well, okay that may overstate the case. It offers a free tier, which allows 1000
interactions per month. Zapier has no free tier, just a free trial. For me, 1000
interactiosn a month is well above my needs, so it's a good fit.

Downsides:
Zapier seems to have a really nice event-driven thing happening where my posts
get migrated more or less immediately. With Make, I have to schedule it. So I've
got it checking 4 times a day at the moment, which means I'll have to remember
to look out for _this_ post later today to be sure it's working as expected. I
can run it manually and that works, so I'm optimistic.

I could tighten up that schedule (the default is 15 minutes) but I don't think I
need it polling my RSS feed 48 times a day. Maybe this will leave me room to
explore other automatable tasks.

Anyway, little by little, adding value to this page. Here's hoping this goes off
without a hitch.
