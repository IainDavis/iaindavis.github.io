This post is a catch-up post to explain the purpose of this website, and how I got to this point. Going forward, I intend to post
whatever is going on with development of this website here.

TRUNCATE_HERE

The intent of this site is to provide a landing place for anybody
looking into me as a potential hire, where they could view work I had done and
see engagement with software and the industry in an ongoing way. And to 
learn something about me beyond what's in my CV. I thought it
would be a good place to showcase:

  * Personal projects
  * Code katas
  * Design katas
  
With the design katas in particular, I see an opportunity to showcase the things
an employer might want to know about a prospect: how do they think about design?
How do they communicate ideas to technical and non-technical stakeholders? How
do they make decisions? To be sure, this is an area where I have significant
room for growth, and the hope is that the work done for this site will serve as
much for learning and practice as demonstration.

I started a project a little while ago to help me mitigate some of the
things in GMail that I find to be shortcomings.  (That project isn't
finished, but the progress will be shared here when I get back to it).

While I was working on that, I knew I should be documenting the work. What I'm
selling isn't the product, but the process, and the organization. I'm not
selling the projects I build, I'm selling _how I build projects_. I wasn't
really making the most of the project I was working on until I could say I
was doing that.

For that, I needed a **place** to document the work.  Setting up this
personal showcase space has always been on my agenda, but I figured I needed to
make it a priority to help with my job search.

I already had a personal domain set up. I was using it for email forwarding --
to give me a professional email address distinct from my personal one, without
also having to manage separate Google accounts (with separate billing,
subscriptions, _etc._). I had experience using Docusaurus, and publishing it via
GitHub pages; I maintained a "notes" repository at Intuit, both for organizing
my own thoughts as I worked on something, and also for sharing out certain
things. Also, part of what I want to showcase is well-organized documentation,
so these things are a natural fit.

To be sure, I have a lot still to do here. But I think I've got things to a
point where I need to start worrying about content as much as about my
repositories. People can get here from [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin/in/IainDavis-dev) 
now, so there better be something here for them to see, even if it's not really
any projects (beyond the site itself) just yet.

Hence this catch-up post and getting this blog going.

I'll post a couple more times today, about decisions I've already made, and
about what's coming next for this site. Then the intent is to update this
periodically with my thoughts and decisions related to the development of this
page.

Thanks for visiting!
