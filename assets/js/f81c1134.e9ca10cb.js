To be sure,\\nmarkdown generally (and Docusaurus specifically) supports using the `details`\\nelement. But Docusaurus handling of it adds styling I would not choose to add by\\ndefault, like so:\\n\\n> ```\\n> <details>\\n> <summary>This is an expandable block</summary>\\n> \\n> It has some additional content that you may opt-in to, or simply pass over as you please.\\n> It\'s also obnoxiously removed from the primary flow of the document.\\n> </details>\\n> ```\\n>\\n> <details>\\n> <summary>This is an expandable block</summary>\\n> \\n> It has some additional content that you may opt-into, or simply pass over as you please.\\n> \\n> It\'s also obnoxiously shifted out of the primary flow of the document by\\n> excessive default styling.\\n> </details>\\n\\nThis is fine and good if what you want is to highlight something. But very often\\nwhat I want is to _elide_ something -- to give the reader only the information\\nthey need at the time, and not bury it in unnecessary content. An example might\\nbe instructions on installing Java. Some subset of your team might need those\\ninstructions if they are new joiners, and it should be there in the flow of the\\ndocument where they would expect to find it. But most folks who\'ve been on your\\nteam a while will probably know how to install Java, and can quite happily skip\\nover those instructions.\\n\\nSo I came up with my own little Expandable component:\\n\\n---\\n### Expandable!\\n<Expandable>\\n\\nIt\'s discreet, and it leaves the elided content in place in the regular flow of\\nthe document. It also features simple visual elements to clarify the extent of\\nthe expanded portion. It supports content in:\\n\\n* text\\n* JSX\\n* markdown\\n\\n<h2>Here\'s some JSX</h2>\\n</Expandable>\\n---\\n\\nHere\'s what the code/markdown looks like:\\n```markdown\\n### Expandable\\n<Expandable>\\n\\nIt\'s discreet, and it leaves the elided content in place in the regular flow of\\nthe document. It also features simple visual elements to clarify the extent of\\nthe expanded portion. It supports content in:\\n\\n* text\\n* JSX\\n* markdown\\n\\n<h2>Here\'s some JSX</h2>\\n</Expandable>\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to the above, it supports starting in the expanded state, and custom\\nexpand/collapse prompts. See the [Storybook](http://localhost:3000/storybook/iaindavis.dev/?path=/docs/custom-components-expandable--docs)\\n\\n### What I learned from building this component\\n#### CSS Modules\\nCSS Modules is the default assumption of Docusaurus. I hadn\'t much used it\\nyet... I\'ve used CSS in JS a bit, and `styled-components` a bit. I like CSS\\nModules for keeping things, well, modular. And the simplicity and directness of\\nit is nice. I do like the dynamism that `styled-components` provides though.\\n\\n#### CSS Pseudo-Selectors\\nI also had to give myself a little bit of a refresher on pseudo-selectors. I\\nused `:before` and `:after` to inject the little ornamental circles at the top\\nand bottom of the left-hand line showing the extent of the expandable section.\\n\\n### What I still want to do\\n* I\'d love to introduce an \'exclusive\' option so that you can assign each one to a\\ngroup, and then expanding one block in the group causes the rest to\\nautomatically collapse. Not really sure what the best way to go about producing\\nthe shared state is yet. I suppose maybe swapping out my functional react\\ncomponent with a class component and storing some of the state on the class\\ndefinition, but I\'ll give it some more thought before I jump in. For now, I\'m\\nhappy with how it is.\\n\\n* I also initially played around with a \'title\' property that caused some text to\\nbe rendered above the expandable portion. I eventually landed on the decision\\nthat the surrounding markdown was already suitable for that purpose, but I may\\nchange my mind some time in the future and reintroduce that feature.\\n\\n* Eventually, I\'d like to move this and any other component I build for this\\n  purpose into their own Docusaurus component library so that I can use them in\\n  other repositories as well.\\n\\n* Still need to sort out testing. I\'ve had some difficulty converting my\\n  Storybook stories to Jest tests. Mostly with the import of various assets\\n  being handled differently by Storybook, Jest, and Docusaurus. I\'m working with\\n  several tiers of pre-processing (TypeScript, React/JSX, Storybook, Jest) and\\n  several kinds of files being treated as modules that are not usually (CSS,\\n  MDX). Getting all those things to work in concert has been something of a\\n  challenge. I may do another blog post just on that. But in the mean-time, I\'m\\n  thinking of just using Storybook as a showcase, and relying on something\\n  purpose built for testing. I\'m considering giving Playwright a go for\\n  component testing. Or maybe I\'ll use the Storybook environment directly,\\n  rather than running it through Jest, if I can figure out how to automate that.\\n\\n  Time will tell. For now, I\'m happy to have my new little component that makes\\n  Docusaurus just that little bit more useful to me.\\n\\n\\n[storybook.expandable]:\\n    \'/storybook/iaindavis.dev/?path=/story/custom-components-expandable--default\\n    \\"Expandable component Storybook showcase\\""},{"id":"/2024/09/14/catch-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/09/14/catch-up","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-09-14-catch-up.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-14-catch-up.mdx","title":"Catch-Up Post","description":"This post is a catch-up post to explain the purpose of this website, and how I got to this point.

Going forward, I intend to post\\nwhatever is going on with development of this website here.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe intent of this site is to provide a landing place for anybody\\nlooking into me as a potential hire, where they could view work I had done and\\nsee engagement with software and the industry in an ongoing way. And to \\nlearn something about me beyond what\'s in my CV. I thought it\\nwould be a good place to showcase:\\n\\n  * Personal projects\\n  * Code katas\\n  * Design katas\\n  \\nWith the design katas in particular, I see an opportunity to showcase the things\\nan employer might want to know about a prospect: how do they think about design?\\nHow do they communicate ideas to technical and non-technical stakeholders? How\\ndo they make decisions? To be sure, this is an area where I have significant\\nroom for growth, and the hope is that the work done for this site will serve as\\nmuch for learning and practice as demonstration.\\n\\nI started a project a little while ago to help me mitigate some of the\\nthings in GMail that I find to be shortcomings.  (That project isn\'t\\nfinished, but the progress will be shared here when I get back to it).\\n\\nWhile I was working on that, I knew I should be documenting the work. What I\'m\\nselling isn\'t the product, but the process, and the organization. I\'m not\\nselling the projects I build, I\'m selling _how I build projects_. I wasn\'t\\nreally making the most of the project I was working on until I could say I\\nwas doing that.\\n\\nFor that, I needed a **place** to document the work.  Setting up this\\npersonal showcase space has always been on my agenda, but I figured I needed to\\nmake it a priority to help with my job search.\\n\\nI already had a personal domain set up. I was using it for email forwarding --\\nto give me a professional email address distinct from my personal one, without\\nalso having to manage separate Google accounts (with separate billing,\\nsubscriptions, _etc._). I had experience using Docusaurus, and publishing it via\\nGitHub pages; I maintained a \\"notes\\" repository at Intuit, both for organizing\\nmy own thoughts as I worked on something, and also for sharing out certain\\nthings. Also, part of what I want to showcase is well-organized documentation,\\nso these things are a natural fit.\\n\\nTo be sure, I have a lot still to do here. But I think I\'ve got things to a\\npoint where I need to start worrying about content as much as about my\\nrepositories. People can get here from <LinkedIn label=\\"my LinkedIn profile\\" />\\nnow, so there better be something here for them to see, even if it\'s not really\\nany projects (beyond the site itself) just yet.\\n\\nHence this catch-up post and getting this blog going.\\n\\nI\'ll post a couple more times today, about decisions I\'ve already made, and\\nabout what\'s coming next for this site. Then the intent is to update this\\nperiodically with my thoughts and decisions related to the development of this\\npage.\\n\\nThanks for visiting!"}]}}')}}]);
