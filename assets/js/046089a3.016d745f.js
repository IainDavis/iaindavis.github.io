There are lots of reasons I prefer it to other formats, but one of the key ones is the ability to create tooltips on shapes with a bit of formatting in them which can really aid readability, as well as allowing links. My preference was clinched when I discovered there's a VS Code extension that lets you edit them directly in your IDE, which goes a long way towards achieving a documentation-as-code pattern for your diagrams that tools like Mermaid aim to supply. I love Mermaid, but it tends to hit its limitations pretty quickly as you add complexity. Draw.io brings a capacity to express messy complexity, the ability to embed (via tooltips) a wealth of additional context and external connections, and a semantic richness that I don't think the shapes available to Mermaid will ever achieve. There's just something fundamentally irreplacable about using a visual tool to produce a visual output."}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['One of the things I\'ve struggled to do in Draw.io is to make things reusable. Reusability goes a long way towards justifying the effort you might put into a particular shape you use, but it was not clear to me how to manage different libraries of shapes, beyond the ones that Draw.io gives you, and what you can store on your "scratchpad" in each document.

You just pile shapes into your Scratchpad, and then export them as an XML file (using the ",(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"mxlibrary"})," schema). It's still a bit of a fiddly process from within the in-IDE editor. It won't download or create a file like the web app or local client would, so the best you can do is just generate the XML in a pop-up window in your IDE, then copy/paste that into a new file. But having it directly in VS Code means this is still pretty manageable: I generally just have a dedicated ",(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"diagrams"})," folder with the source and any exported libraries displayed inside.
