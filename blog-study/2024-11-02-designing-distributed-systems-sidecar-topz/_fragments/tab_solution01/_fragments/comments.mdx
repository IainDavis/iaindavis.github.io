This turned out to be as much or more an exercise in learning NGINX as a lesson in the sidecar pattern, but I seem to have gotten there in the end.

I've gone through several iterations, with only the final iteration captured here. The first iteration exposed all of the cAdvisor paths as top-level paths, just below the root, (_e.g._, /containers, /docker, _etc._). It occurred to me to apply the sidecar as a general pattern, it was probably wiser to use a less-ambiguous path (some hypthetical 'main application' might conceivably require a `containers` path at the root), and to only occupy one namespace for the cadvisor paths, so the second solution takes that approach, using `sub_filter` directives to rewrite URLs in the HTML returned from the downstream cAdvisor service, so that all urls meant to redirect to the sidecar have paths prefixed with `/cadvisor`.

A good deal of this work was also teasing out which suggestions of the AI were valuable and which were not. For example, when I had some links that were not working correctly, the AI suggested rewriting all relative paths, which ended up having disastrous consequences for loading non-html resources like stylesheets and scripts, and proved unnecessary anyway. Another dubious AI suggestion was using `$host:$server_port` to force re-written URLs to have the correct port address. It turns out the correct solution was to use the `$http_host` variable, but the AI continued to suggest the other usage.

Taking a step back to more general observations, I find that the AI (in this case ChatGPT 4o) does pretty well with general purpose languages like JavaScript, but falters a bit with purpose-built languages like the configuration language in NGINX or other DSLs. Not sure if that observation will hold up to scrutiny over time. But I will keep it in mind.
