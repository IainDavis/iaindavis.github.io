## Challenges
1. The author doesn't provide the main application for the exercise

    In the absence of having a specific application to run, on the
    advice of my code-assistant AI, I've opted to use a standard NGINX
    container as my base application. This gives me some default
    behavior for the "main application" that can be observed to verify the setup

2. The provided image expects a `Linux/AMD64` architecture.
    My code assistant AI has suggested two alternatives:
    1. use an alternate sidecar application (cAdvisor)
    2. Build a Multi-Archtecture Image of Topz
    
Since this is all practice, I will try both approaches
