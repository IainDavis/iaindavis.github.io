### Solution Artifacts
The [solution][solution-root] is implemented as
- an [nginx.conf][nginx-conf] file that contains the service configuration
- a [docker-compose.yaml][docker-compose] file that contains the docker network and container information

[solution-root]: 
    https://github.com/IainDavis/book-exercises/tree/main/designing-distributed-systems/sidecar/topz/01
    (directory with all solution files)

[nginx-conf]:
    https://github.com/IainDavis/book-exercises/blob/main/designing-distributed-systems/sidecar/topz/01/nginx.conf
    (solution 01 NGINX configuration)

[docker-compose]:
    https://github.com/IainDavis/book-exercises/blob/main/designing-distributed-systems/sidecar/topz/01/docker-compose.yaml
    (solution 01 docker-compose file which creates the containers and shared network)
