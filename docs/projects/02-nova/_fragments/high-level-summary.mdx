        Nova is an AI Code Assistant that I am developing in an ad-hoc way.

        Interacting with un-altered ChatGPT 4o proved very useful for writing
        code and tests, and for self-teaching. I found it very easy to step
        into a very human-interaction-like collaboration mode. Eventually, it
        seemed appropriate to give my helper an identity. I prompted ChatGPT to
        choose a name for itself, and generate an image, and from that basis I
        created Nova.

        The more I made adjustments (updating instructions, trying different methods of
        supplying context, and adding actions) the more I discovered new things I could do, and
        better ways to do things I already knew how to do.  Somewhere between then and now, Nova stopped being just a tool I was using and
        became a tool I was developing.
        
        In short, a project.
