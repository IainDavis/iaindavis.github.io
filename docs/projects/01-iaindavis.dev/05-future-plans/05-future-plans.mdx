## Component for previewing Google Drive documents (Docs and Sheets)
    Docusaurus is not great for simultaneous collaborative work.
    What tends to happen is you get a bunch of individual
    documents scattered across many people's Google Drives.

    I want Docusaurus to be a one-stop-shop for all the information about a
    project. By loading Google Drive documents in iframes, you can achieve that.

    Docs are protected just as they would be if viewed in Google
    Drive directly, and are viewable and editable within the
    iframe, along with any comments and annotations.

    I intend to build a component that encapsulates this approach,
## Visibility into my personal Jira
    So interested parties (potential employers) can see what my Jira stories look like, etc.
## More Content
    I don't want to enumerate the planned content additions I have, because
    it'll have me back here every couple days updating this list over the
    next few weeks. Rest assured, I am working to make sure there is
    something here worth viewing soon.
    At a minimum, that includes improving that front page and updating the
    footer so the links are relevant to me.
## Component Updates
## Add Lazy-Loading to `Expandable` Component
## Add `exclusive` Feature to `Expandable` Component
    Introduce the option to collapse all other `Expandable` blocks in the
    same group when a new one is expanded.

## Aspirational Nice-To-Haves
## Comments Section!
    A major shortcoming of Docusaurus is its lack of an in-place feedback
    mechanism. For me, this is the essential thing Confluence has that Docusaurus lacks.

    There are several add-on solutions available, and I intend to use
    this site to explore those options.
## Some sort of API call
    That's awfully vague isn't it? Truth is, I don't know what I
    want to add just yet, this is more about making this site a
    useful tech-demo than any demands of the site itself.

    To be clear, were this an actual documentation site, I can
    think of _lots_ of uses for incorporating external data into
    Docusaurus. Feature flags? Status of recent builds? Downstream
    dependencies live and responding?
## Authentication
    I've implemented OAuth (with GitHub) in a GitHub pages experiment
    before, and I'd like to do it again. The great bulk of this site is
    intended to be public, but I'm not entirely thrilled with the `preview`
    environments being publicly viewable, so I may put those behind some
    kind of auth
## Preview-Environment Indicator
    Add some kind of visual indication when the user is viewing a preview
    environment built off a PR, rather than the main production branch. This
    will likely be in the form of some red text with a red border reading
    'Preview | PR-##'
