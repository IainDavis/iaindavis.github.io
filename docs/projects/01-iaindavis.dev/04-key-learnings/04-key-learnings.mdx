title: Key Learnings
---
A lot of the things I've learned working on this site have been about
getting into details that have been abstracted away, when working for
a big enterprise corporation with pre-established "Paved Roads".

Getting various JavaScript tools to work together peaceably, setting up a
preview environment, or a CI/CD flow, or thinking about accessibility... these
things all used to be done for me.

## TypeScript
I'm fluent with TypeScript to the extent that I can usually make it do
what I want, and anyone reading my TypeScript code doesn't themselves
have to be a TypeScript expert to understand it.

That said, there's always more to learn. In this project that has been more
about the slow accumulation of fluency, rather than any new features.

I started using TypeScript about a year ago, I'd guess, and it's quickly become
my language of choice.

## AI
I'm including my AI Code Assistant as a separate project. You can see more about
these learnings there. Suffice it to say that really getting my hands dirty with
AI and incorporating it into my workflow has been a revelation about what is
possible, and how it will change the way I work.

## JavaScript/TypeScript EcoSystem
I've been aware of the challenges of the JavaScript ecosystem for some
time...  the need for preprocessing (transpiling & type-checking) and
integration of various independent tools (linters, test libraries,
etc.) and then making all of those things work together. But this
detail has largely been obscured from me in the past by paved roads.
Sure, I've had to tweak an integration here or there, but building a
JavaScript/TypeScript entity with some fairly complex interactions
from the ground up has been a new experience, and I feel like I
understand things like Babel and Webpack a little better than I did
before.

## Accessibility
My AI Code assistant pointed out I wasn't following accessibility best-practices. 

### Key Learning: Use the 'Hidden' Attribute
The 'hidden' attribute is semantically more-correct than simply omitting a
subtree from the during rendering. Omitting elements also runs the risk of
creating an WAI-ARIA attribute referencing an ID that is not there. 

#### Additional learning:
Using 'hidden' means that test matchers like `expect(element).toBeVisible()`
work correctly, where simply applying CSS styles may not.

### Key Learning: Focus Management
Directing the browser focus to the right element can make a huge difference in
the usability of your compnent for someone relying on assistive technologies
like screen readers.

## CSS Modules
Previously I used [`styled-components`][styled-components] (or CSS-in-JS) for React component
styling.

Achieving the dynamism possible with `styled-components` is a challenge with CSS
Modules, but it's undoubtedly simpler to use, and I like the modularity of it.

## Figma
As a Software Engineer, I never really had much call to use Figma, although I've
viewed numerous Figma documents when working with Designers. I've been able to
get what I need out of `diagrams.net`, or in a real pinch, Inkscape.

The brand work for this project is the first time I created anything in Figma
myself, and I have to say, I'm prettly pleased with it. The ability to set up
themes alone seems worth the price of admission.

## GitHub Actions
This site has been my first foray into GitHub Actions, which I am using for:
* CI/CD
    * preview build deployment
    * production build deployment
* AI Code Assistant integration
    * generating a repository map that my code assistant can use for inference

## Habit
I spent a lot of time [trying to "fix" Jest][jest-fix], so that it would read the new
`mdx-js/mdx` package, which no longer supportx CommonJS. This was based purely on 
taking for granted that "Jest is what I use for testing JavaScript".

Ultimately, I abandoned Jest in favor of Vitest, which solved the
problems I was having, with the additional benefit of running the
tests faster.

### Key Learning: Explore alternatives sooner
I need to be more open to throwing away the things I'm taking for granted.
