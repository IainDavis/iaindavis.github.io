## Project Summary
### What It Is
This project is a Google AppsScript program that combines a Cover Letter template (as
a Google Doc) with row data from a spreadsheet of job listings to
create customized cover letters for each listing.

### Why I Built It
Google Docs requires a subscription to use variables in a document. A
roll-your-own solution saves a monthly expense and:
* simplifies data-entry
* gives me one source-of-truth (the spreadsheet) for my job search process
* saves time and potential for error in manually editing cover letters

And, as ever, it's an opportunity to learn. This is not my first
AppsScript project, but it's my first time dealing with the Drive,
Docs, and Sheets features in a meaningful way.

Also, I'm petty, and I resent Google withholding this simple essential feature.
