File creates a custom menu in the Google Sheets app so the script can
be run without having to open the script editor in another tab.

Note that the `onOpen` function is supposed to run automatically when
the document opens, but to make this work, I had to set up an explicit
trigger in the AppsScript editor.

```javascript title="ui.gs" showLineNumbers
function onOpen() {
  const ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  ui.createMenu('Job Listing Tools')
    .addItem('Generate Cover Letters', 'generateCoverLetters')
    .addToUi();
}

```
