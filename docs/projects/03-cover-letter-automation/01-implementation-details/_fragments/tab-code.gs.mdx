Code.gs is the entry point for the script, and performs high-level orchestration.

I would probably be wise to extract the late-added logic that writes
the URL of the created (or updated) cover-letter to the spreadsheet
into it's own module, but I've already invested a lot of time in this,
and it's essentially a one-liner.

```javascript title="Code.gs" showLineNumbers
function generateCoverLetters() {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp
    // this is a bound script -- activeSpreadsheet is always the same sheet, and always non-null
    .getActiveSpreadsheet()
    .getSheetByName(JOB_LISTINGS_SHEET_NAME);

  const effectiveRange = getEffectiveRange(sheet);
  const jobListingRows = effectiveRange.getValues();
  
  for ([i, listingRow] of jobListingRows.entries()){
    if(listingRow.every(value => value === '')) continue;
    const listing = mapDataRowToJobListingRecord(listingRow);

    const coverLetterFile = createCoverLetterPathAndFile(listing);
    updateCoverLetter(coverLetterFile, listing);
    
    sheet.getRange(effectiveRange.getRow() + i, 7).setFormula(`=HYPERLINK("${coverLetterFile.getUrl()}", "Cover Letter")`);
  };
}

function onOpen() {
  const ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  ui.createMenu('Job Listing Tools')
    .addItem('Generate Cover Letters', 'generateCoverLetters')
    .addToUi();
}
```
