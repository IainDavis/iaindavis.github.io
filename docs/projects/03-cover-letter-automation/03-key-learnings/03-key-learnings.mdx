title: Key Learnings

## Google AppsScript
This is my second foray into Google AppsScript. There's not much to
learn about AppsScript itself, it's basically JavaScript. But there's
plenty to learn about the Google APIs exposed in it. My previous
effort is more or less scoped to GMail only -- this was my first time
using different Google Services in an inter-dependent way. It was
interesting seeing the trade-offs Google have made. They seem to be
maintaining separation of concerns in ways that maybe are sacrificing
the utility of the platform. Certainly there are things that
intuitively seemed I should be able to do, that I could not do.

## Compose and Decorator
I'm really fond of both of these patterns. I think they go along way
towards making your code comprehensible, declarative, and self-documenting.

## Functions, Arrow Functions, and Hoisting
I think I've just gotten so used to modules, I forgot you sometimes
have to ensure you define things before you use them. It turns out, in
AppsScript (and perhaps elsewhere), conventional functions (using the
`function` keyword) are hoisted and can be invoked anywhere. Arrow
functions are not.

## Function Names
I didn't expect to find that function names are immutable. I had hoped
to use the `Function.name` property in my logging decorators, but that
only worked if the base function I wanted to invoke was directly below
the logging decorator in the call stack. If anything intervened, the
logging decorator no longer had access to `Function.name` for the base function.

In the end, I just supplied an explicit string to the logging decorator, which is a bit
inelegant, but it works.
