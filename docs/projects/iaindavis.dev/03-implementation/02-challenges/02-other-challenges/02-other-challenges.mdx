## Docusaurus Diff Formatting
Docusaurus `diff` highlighting didn't work properly in code blocks --
no highlights appeared in the rendered output at all.

<Expandable>
### Solution
Define "magic comments" in remark configuration and custom CSS styles for
add/remove highlights.

:::info
[Magic comments][magic-comments] are a remark feature that applies a CSS style to the next line in
the output.
:::

See [this blog post][diff-blog-post] for more details.

### Bonus Win
This approach means that Docusaurus code blocks retain their original
syntax highlighting for the underlying language!

### Caveat
Adding or removing more than just a line or two results in ugly
write-time markdown.

There is a [more robust fix][more-robust-fix]
that may be applied later, but for now this restores an essential feature
with minimal effort

## Module Hell With Jest
During development Docusaurus was updated from v3.2 to v3.5. That
carried with it an update to `mdx-js` to `v3`, which changed from a
hybrid CommonJS/ESModules package to being purely ESModules, which
entirely broke Jest (which relies on CommonJS for importing modules.).

<Expandable>

    This was compounded by Jest not performing according to it's
    documentation.

    Jest allows custom transformers. As of Jest v28 (this
    site was using v29 at the time), those transformers conform to an
    interface that requires _either_ a synchronous `process` function or an
    asynchronous `processAsync` function. If the `processAsync` function is supplied,
    Jest should prefer it, and the `process` function should be irrelevant.

    That _should_ have allowed a dynamic import (inherently asynchronous)
    of the problem module. Unfortunately, Jest continually insisted

    * using the synchronous `process` function, if it was supplied
    * failing to compile if `process` was not supplied

    ### Solution
    Abandon Jest.

    I explored alternatives with my AI and landed on using
    [Vitest][https://vitest.dev/].

    Vitest is built with an ESModules-first mindset. But there was _still_
    a problem because Vitest also uses an underlying library for module
    import that depends on CommonJS. But in the case of Vitest, the
    dynamic import solution [worked as expected.][mdx-dynamic-import]
