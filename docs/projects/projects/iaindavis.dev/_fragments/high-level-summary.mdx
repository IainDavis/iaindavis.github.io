        When I was included in a round of layoffs that closed our entire
        Sydney office, I thought I'd better start cultivating an internet
        presence that demonstrates how I work and think about software, but I
        didn't have any central place to share my work out (or any
        non-proprietary work I could share, for that matter).  This project is
        the website I am building to resolve that deficit. It's here to serve
        as a place to collect demonstrative examples of my work, and to serve
        as one itself.  It's also a central point of access to find me in
        various social media locations around the internet.
