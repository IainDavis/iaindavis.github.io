title: Major Segments

import Expandable from '@site/src/components/Expandable/Expandable';

As of this writing, this website features three broad segments relying on different technologies

### Website
The core of this site is a Docusaurus static documentation site,
making use of primarily the `docs` and `blog` plugins.

The bulk of the content is written in MDX with occasional use of
Mermaid diagrams and other Docusaurus extensions.

Docusaurus provides a customizable navbar and footer that is applicable to all plugins.

Custom UI elements
are React (18) components, written in TypeScript.

    #### Pages
    Static pages managed by the Docusaurus 'pages' plugin. Currently limited to the landing page.

    #### Docs
    The bulk of the planned content relies on the Docusaurus 'docs' plugin. Docs feature an auto-generated sidebar and table of contents, as well as forward/back navigation.

    #### Blog
    A developer blog is currently the only use of the Docusaurus 'blog' plugin, but this may be extended at a later date to include a release history/changelog and any other time-series types of information.
    The blog page features time-sequential ordering, a 'recent items' menu, grouping posts by tag, and sharing profile information about the author(s)

### Custom Components
This site features a small (but growing) number of custom React
components to extend the in-built capabilities of Docusaurus

### Storybook
A Storybook showcase of the custom components has been integrated with
the website and published alongside it
[here](https://iaindavis.dev/storybook/iaindavis.dev)

Storybook stories have also been incorporated into the unit test suite.

### Reports
Building the website generates reports, which are shared on the website.
Currently generated reports are:
* Unit tests (pass/fail for individual tests)
* Unit test coverage
