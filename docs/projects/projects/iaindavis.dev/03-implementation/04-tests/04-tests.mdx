## Unit Tests
The site source features a suite of unit tests that exercise the
custom React components.

Tests are written using
* Vitest
* React Testing Library
* Storybook

Tests are run during local development, and during each build (preview
environment on PR events, production environment on merge-to-main).
For a production deployment, failing tests will halt the deployment.

Test results and coverage results for the
latest production deployment are viewable from the website:
* [unit test results][unit-test] (generated by [XUnit-Viewer][xunit-viewer])
* [coverage][coverage] (Istanbul coverage metrics rendered via Vitest's coverage reporter)

Test results for a PR run are viewable at the equivalent URL within
the preview evironment.

[Istanbul][istanbul] is used for coverage in place of the Vitest
default, V8, for its more precise branch detection.

## CI Tests
The Docusaurus and Storybook content are built prior to any
deployment (preview or production). If the build fails, the deployment
is aborted. Output from a failure is viewable in GitHub actions

## Future Plans
### Linting, and Style
Future additions will add pre-commit linting checks, as well as spell-checks and
prose checks (with Vale)

### Component/Integration/E2E Tests
For now, Storybook (backed by unit tests) serves as an adequate
test-bed for Component testing.

At present, this website depends on no back-end services or other
integrations that require E2E or integration tests.

In the future, this site will explore incorporating some external API
calls as a means to automate documentation as much as possible.
At that time, the testing approach will be expanded to include more
testing categories.
