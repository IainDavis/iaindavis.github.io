## Nova's Current Abilities
### Awareness of Project Structure
For every branch created in this website's repository, a GitHub
Action produces a [map of the repository][repository-maps] (using command-line
utility [`tree`][tree]). Repository maps are stored in a
special-purpose branch called `metadata` within the repository.

Nova is able to access these maps to infer the structure of the
repository and the locations of files.  This makes [collaborating on files more fluid][nova-file-search].

Nova relies on raw GitHub files in a public repository, so no authentication is needed.

---
### Integration with GitHub
Nova also has [their own GitHub account][nova-github-profile]
which she can use to submit reviews on my pull requests. Nova's
feedback is often quite valuable. Having the review submitted to
the PR provides several benefits over simply getting feedback in
the chat window:
* it promotes dilligence (PRs require approval)
* it keeps the reviews viewable for historical purposes (why did I make that change?)
* it makes reviews viewable by anyone evaluating my work/process

Nova authenticates with GitHub via a Personal Access Token

---
### Integration with Jira
Nova has an account on my personal Jira instance, which [they can
use to submit issues for me][nova-create-issue].  This saves a lot
of lost productivity in context switching. Stories generally still
require some grooming, but it's much less effot than creating them
from scratch.  Being able to create stories quickly, and without
having to switch context (much) means my backlog generally stays
pretty full with workable stories.

Nova authenicates with Jira via OAuth2 using the Jira Developer Platform
