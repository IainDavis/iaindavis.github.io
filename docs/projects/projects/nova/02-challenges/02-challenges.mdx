## GitHub robots.txt
### Problem:
Early in my interactions with Nova, I struggled to get them to
correctly identify, then retrieve, a file from my repository to
perform some analysis on it. Nova would insist they didn't have the
capacity to view public files, and prompt me to just copy/paste the
code into the chat window, which is exactly the sort of
context-switching I wanted to avoid.

### Solution
Eventually I discovered that GitHub employs a
[robots.txt][about-robots] file to prevent crawlers from accessing
sites. I further discovered that the same does not apply to the 'raw'
versions of files available on the `raw.githubusercontent.com` domain.

Now Nova knows to check the relevant `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL.

## GitHub file paths
### Problem
With the above problem solved, Nova was able to retrieve files if given the
absolute path, but giving her the filename either didn't get the result I
wanted, or else required an additional API call to perform a search so that the
correct path could be inferred.

### Solution
A GitHub Action executes on every branch creation within the repository to
create a map of the repository (using command-line utility [tree][tree]). Maps
are stored in a special-purpose [`metadata` branch][] of the
repository which does not share commit history with the rest of the
repository. Nova knows to find them there, and can now correctly infer file
locations given a file name.

## Jira Auth
### Problem 1
Jira allows authentication via Basic Auth or OAuth.

I could not get the OAuth configuration to work. The authentication went as
expected, but then the redirect came back to the wrong URL, and I'd have to
authenticate again.

### Problem 2
I was able to partially work around the above problem by using Basic
auth. All of the calls I wanted to make were sent successfully from my
[REST Client file][rest-client-file]. But when I had Nova perform the same
actions, using the same credentials, they were rejected for failing to return
the `XSRF` token.

### Solution
In the end it turns out OAuth was working just fine. The difficulty
was a usability issue in the ChatGPT UI. When you edit a GPT, or its
actions, you work in a temporary preview space that lets you trial
changes before committing them. When Jira's OAuth implementation was
redirecting, it was returning to the wrong URL.  Committing the
changes and _then_ testing them solved the problem.

Thanks to [this article] for helping finally identify the issue.
