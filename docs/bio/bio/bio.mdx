I'm a full-stack software engineer with five years experience working for
a Fortune 500 company in the fintech industry. Originally from
the U.S., Iâ€™ve been living in Australia as a permanent
resident since mid-2020.

I'm most comfortable working in JavaScript/TypeScript, but I
have fairly extensive Java experience as well. I've done
significant development with React, Redux, and Spring Boot. I
have experience with AWS, and various flavors of SQL.

My past projects include international collaboration on
projects with global scope and enterprise scale. These include
product offerings as well as internal tooling.

Code quality and maintainability are important to me, as are
dev experience and documentation. I like to know my tools well
so that I can make the best use of them.
