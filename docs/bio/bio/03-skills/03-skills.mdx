## Languages
### JavaScript
<Summary>
    I first started using JavaScript during my internship at
    Intuit in 2018.

    I'm a big fan. Features like the nullish coalescing operator
    and the spread operator really can simplify your code a great
    deal. I'm also fond of async/await, and Promise.all, for how
    they simplify asynchronous actions.

    I've also gravitated from strict OOP in my more Java-centric
    days to a more functional style, largely thanks to JavaScript
    and TypeScript.

</Summary>

### TypeScript
<Summary>
    I was introduced to TypeScript as part of the Books-to-Tax
    project on the Cronulla team at Intuit Sydney. I was
    skeptical, at first, that JavaScript **needed** a type system,
    but I came around in the end.

    This is my language of choice, these days. All the benefits of
    JavaScript, plus type-safety and code completion. If I'm
    setting out to write something myself, I'll generally reach
    for TypeScript first. I would describe my TypeScript skills as
    "good enough to accomplish what I need to, not so good that
    anyone reading my code also has to be a TypeScript expert. I'm
    learning all the time how to write more concise TypeScript"

    I still have a long way to go learning the configuration options

</Summary>

### Java
<Summary>
    This was the language-of-preference at my university (SJSU, 2015-2018). All
    of my training in Object-Oriented Programming and Design was in Java.
    Also, during my time at Intuit in San Diego, the majority of the
    back-ends we worked on were written in Java (+ framework).

    I've used v8, v11, and v17. I like to write using the Streams API.

    Most of the back-ends we've worked on at Intuit Sydney (2021-2024)
    have been Node back-ends, so my Java is a bit rusty, but I'm quite
    confident I could pick it up again quickly.
</Summary>

### Groovy
<Summary>
    I'm nothing like a Groovy expert, but I did work on a Spring Boot
    repository during the PrISM Sunset project where all of the tests
    were written in Groovy. I _really_ liked some of the tools it has
    for navigating and parsing structured data. It had features that
    were a bit like Python that way. Would love to work in Groovy (or
    something like it) again.
</Summary>

### C
<Summary>
    My earliest formal training was in C. It was the lingua-franca at
    De Anza College (2012-2015, the last year before they switched to
    Java), and all my training in basic programming concepts and Data
    Structures was implemented in C.  I've done a fair bit of work
    with Abstract Data Types in C.
    
    That's all pretty long ago now, though. I'm fond of C, but I
    haven't worked with it in ages.
</Summary>

### Python
<Summary>
    Limited, but some hands-on experience. I've done some study and
    tutorials, but my most hand-on work with Python was writing the
    validation scripts for the PrISM sunset work at Intuit San Diego
    (2019-2020).

    I've never worked in any Python frameworks.
</Summary>

### Ruby
<Summary>
    Quite limited. We took over some assets from the LATAM region that
    were written in Ruby. Our job was just to provide continuing
    support until those assets could be decommissioned, but I did give
    myself a bit of a Ruby crash-course to prepare for that. To do any
    serious development though, I'd have to learn a good bit.
</Summary>

### VB/VBA
<Summary>
    I took some introductory courses in VB. Let's not talk about it anymore.
</Summary>

### ActionScript
<Summary>
    ActionScript was "my first love," so to speak. It's the language
    that brought me to programming in the early 2000s.(via Macromedia
    Flash). I never use it anymore, but it'll always have a place in
    my heart.
</Summary>

## Frameworks
### React
<Summary>
    I suppose I probably first encountered React in any meaningful way
    at Intuit Sydney (2021-2024), but it's essentially my go-to for
    front end work, now.
</Summary>

### Spring Boot
<Summary>
    Spring Boot was the framework of choice at Intuit San Diego
    (2020-2021). Almost every service we had was built on it. I've had
    a good deal of experience working in Spring Boot, but also dealing
    with the idiosyncracies of Spring Boot packages (different folder
    structure). I also have non-trivial experience engaging with the
    Spring data layer, writing JQL queries, understanding foreign-key
    relationships and who "owns" them, and how those queries get
    translated into SQL instructions.
</Summary>

### Docusaurus
<Summary>
    I'm a Docusaurus evangelist. I'm sure there are other frameworks
    doing similar things, so maybe it's fairer to say I'm an MDX
    evangelist, and Docusaurus is just the framework I'm most familiar
    with. I think documentation generally is a big deficit in this
    industry, and Docusaurus promises to improve the situation by
    making large chunks of documentation either re-usable or
    automatable.
</Summary>

---
## Build Tools
### Maven
<Summary>
    Probably most of my experience directly manipulating a build tool
    has been with Maven. I've had experience with multi-module
    projects, Spring Boot projects, the `shade` plugin, adjusting
    build order, etc. etc.
</Summary>

### Gradle
<Summary>
    Limited experience, but it seems mostly pretty similar to Maven. Confident I can engage with it productively
</Summary>

### Webpack
<Summary>
    Mostly I've dealt with webpack as a tool that runs transparently
    to me. It's mostly since I've been working on this website that
    I've had to get into any deeper interaction with it, which has
    mostly been about changing module loaders, and syncing babel
    configurations across Storybook and Docusaurus. I'm certainly not
    afraid to get in it and get my hands dirty, though.
</Summary>

### Vite
<Summary>
    I've had my first hands-on experience with Vite setting up this website.
    (I'm using Vitest for my unit tests). I've not had to do much
    configuration with it, but I'm pretty impressed by its speed. Even
    with my tiny limited test suite, the difference is noticable.
    Looking forward to working with it in the future. For now,
    Docusaurus keeps me tethered to Webpack.
</Summary>

---
## Databases
### SQL
<Summary>
    I've had to work with many flavors of SQL. Most commonly that's
    been MySQL/MariaDB, but I've also had non-trivial interactions
    with SQL Server that included digging into stored procedures. I've
    also performed a major-version upgrade on a PostgreSQL server that
    required getting into the weeds a bit on replication.

    Not an expert, but not really a fresh-faced newbie, either.

    I've also occasionally used SQLite in my own projects.
</Summary>

### Dynamo DB
<Summary>
    I've had some limited interaction with Dynamo DB. Pretty much all just access, no setup or configuration.
</Summary>

### Redis
<Summary>
    More or less the same as Dynamo DB
</Summary>

### Other NoSQL implementations
<Summary>
    Intuit has its own proprietary persistence solutions, which I have
    had significant engagement with.
</Summary>

---
## Cloud Platforms
### AWS
<Summary>
    A few years ago, Intuit switched from all owned datacenters to
    fully hosted on AWS. I've never been a DevOps guru, but I have had
    many opportunities to work with AWS. In particular, I've worked
    with EC2 Instances (including Security Groups and Auto-Scaling
    rules), CloudWatch, CloudFront, S3, RDS (performed a major-version
    upgrade on a PostgreSQL cluster with replication), a bit of Route53.
    The AWS Console is familiar to me, and I've been in fairly diverse areas of the space.

    I've also used AWS in my personal projects, although I tend to
    avoid it these days, as I like to keep my projects free, to the
    extent that is possible.
</Summary>

---
## Containers/Deployments
### Docker
Some experience, although mostly as a user of Docker appliances. I
have done some training on creating Docker images/containers from the
command line, but I've seldom had to set anything up for myself in
practice.

### Kubernetes
I have a fair amount of experience engaging with Kubernetes as a user
of Kubernetes deployments. To that end, I've looked at configurations,
mostly in a troubleshooting mode, but rarely had to set one up
directly. I have done some off-duty exploration of interacting with
Kubernetes via the command line using `kubectrl` and done some
organized training about basic kubernetes concepts. I'm hardly an
expert, but I'm familiar with basic concepts.

---
## Test Frameworks
### JUnit
<Summary>
    I've extensively used JUnit in both its v4 and v5 versions. I've written my own JUnit 5 extensions to
    * isolate tests with respect to the system properties
    * make logging a testable element
</Summary>

### Jest
<Summary>
    Jest has been the only test framework I've used for
    JavaScript/TypeScript up until this website (which uses Vitest,
    very similar to Jest). I'm quite familiar with this tool and have
    written module mocks at both global and local scope, and am very
    comfortable with the parameterized tests API.
</Summary>

### React Testing
<Summary>
    I've done testing of React components using both Enzyme and React-Testing-Library
</Summary>

### Karate
<Summary>
    Karate is Intuit's in-house declarative test-writing tool (open
    sourced). I've used it. I won't lie, I kind of hate it. But I have
    successfully used it.
</Summary>

### Cypress
<Summary>
    We used Cypress for our E2E tests in the Books-to-Tax project.  I
    really like the UX for Cypress, nice preview environment, the
    logging is great, and the ability to step back through test events
    is really, really wonderful. I'm less enthusiastic about the
    developer experience.  Cypress introduces a lot of its own idioms
    to handle asynchronicity and what is exposed within the tests
    themselves, and learning it is a bit like learning an entirely new
    language.

    I've had extensive experience with Cypress. I wrote a module to
    automate creation of test accounts (using Intuit's test-account
    API) and make them available to the tests.
</Summary>

### Playwright
<Summary>
    I've used Playwright a good deal less than Cypress, but I'm very
    pleased that it uses much more conventional JavaScript syntax.
    Looking forward to working with it more in the future so I can
    make a more thorough comparison against Cypress.
</Summary>

---
## Tools
### Storybook
<Summary>
    I first used Storybook on the Books-to-Tax project at Intuit
    Sydney (2021-2024). Our senior included it in the project to allow
    the front end work to proceed before the back-end work was in
    place (at the time we were sharing the project with another team
    who had the back-end responsibility). We integrated a mock API
    which allowed the front-end work to proceed right away. I was also
    really impressed with how it tightened up the feedback loop. It's
    a whole lot easier to view your modified component in the
    Storybook preview environment than to get it loaded up into a
    deployed E2E environment that might still require multiple
    page-navigations to get to the change you wanted to see. It was
    also great for simulating load times, failed calls, etc. All the
    non-happy-path circumstances.

    This website has been my first foray into setting up Storybook for
    myself (To be fair, it may be overkill in this instance). I don't
    think I'll do any significant React development without it (or
    something like it) again.
    
    I've used a fair few of Storybook's extension features, including
    setting up my own decorators and plugins (the storybook for this
    site includes a decorator that translates Storybook's theme
    implementation into one that applies to Docusaurus's components)
</Summary>

### Confluence/Jira
<Summary>
    A lot of exposure to Jira as a developer. I'm using it now in my
    own projects, which is giving me a bit more notion of the project
    administrator side as well.  I've used Confluence a great deal,
    but it was the Confluence Enterprise product, which I suspect was
    several versions out of date.
</Summary>

### Splunk
<Summary>
    I've got better-than-beginner abilities with Splunk. I can do the
    odd join, or arrive at derived values, and use those as the basis
    for dashboards.

    not a Splunk Wizard, but competent beyond just "find this userID or transaction ID".
</Summary>

### Excel/Google Sheets
<Summary>
    I firmly believe that this is an underrated skill among developers
    and software engineers. The ability to present data in a way that
    is comprehensible to non-technical people, but also that can be
    sliced-and-diced in ways that reveal things about the data is really valuable.
</Summary>

---
## Soft Skills
### Determined Problem-Solver
<Summary>
    I like to understand how things work. That usually means I'm well
    suited to understand why they **don't** work, too. I dig in and
    often work from first principles until I can get to an answer
</Summary>

### Good Written Communication
<Summary>
    Hopefully, this website serves as evidence of this.

    I tend to write highly structured PRs... my goal is to answer as
    many questions for the reviewer as I can, before they ask them.

    That usually means describing the intent of the change, as well as
    any trade-offs consciously made.

    Good written communication isn't just about choosing the right
    words, but also about **organization of information**. I think far
    too many developers tend to just do a brain-dump (understandably,
    given time pressures) and say "well, at least it's out there". But
    extracting the actual knowledge out of that sort of documentation
    can be a time-consuming and exhausting chore.
</Summary>

### Collaborator
<Summary>
    One of my favorite collaborations has been with a tax-expert, who
    wasn't a software person at all. We worked together to determine
    the appropriate mapping from accounting categories to lines on a
    tax form. We interacted across a 17-hour time zone difference,
    through occasional short meetings, Slack, and a lot of Google Sheets.
</Summary>
