There's a lot of writing here. I considered leaving out some of my
more personal challenges, but there's a lot here that I think speaks
to my character and determination (and stubbornness), how far I've
come as a person who believes in working for things, and my
unconventional background (for a software engineer) and I think maybe
that's relevant to some of the people who come to this page to learn
more about me.

### Early Work Experience
<RightFloated width="35%">

        middle-school. All are smiling. Two girls have their
        tongues out. Another is making a kissy face. The boy looks a little bewildered.

        and my gang of friends from the Junior High School band.
        Best guess is that this is our graduation from
        middle-school. Girl on the left was 2nd trombone. I adored
        her. Girl in the middle played flute. She adored me. It
        was complicated."

My earliest work experience is accompanying my Dad on construction
jobs, which started when I was about 10 or so. We did a lot of
residential work, mostly remodels on single-family homes, and
turn-overs on rental properties between one tenant and the next. I did
a fair bit of fetching tools, but also a good bit of drywall, carpentry,
minor electrical, and plumbing. And painting. I hate painting.

At sixteen, I got the first job I got on my own steam (if not my own
initiative) which was custom picture framing. I was a seasonal hire
for about two months, putting absolutely terrible cut-rate frames on
poor quality prints. I was able to parlay that first job into another
role doing custom picture framing at a more reputable retail outlet.
Picture framing has been available to me multiple times in my life
when I've needed work, and altogether, I've worked in that industry
for close to fifteen years, all over the San Francisco Bay Area and in
Denver, Colorado.

### High School Drop-Out

        bunch of red roses sits in a vase on a pedestal just in
        front of them. A caption at the bottom reads "Captured In
        A Dream Santa Clara High School May 4, 1996"

I was a pretty poor student in high school. I started well, but lost
interest early. At 17, when it was clear I wasn't going to
graduate, I got my [G.E.D.][tt-ged]. I enrolled at West Valley
Community College in Saratoga, CA, but quickly discovered that my lack
of motivation hadn't been improved by enrolling in college. I went to all my
art classes, skipped the rest, and didn't re-enroll at the end of the
semester.

I moved from California at 18 to live with my mother in Denver, and
try to make a fresh start. I returned to picture framing, still
telling myself I was going to go to art school, but doing nothing
about it.

### Military Enlistement

Eventually I recognized that my current path was going nowhere. So, in
April of 2001, I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force.  On the strong
encouragement of my recruiter, I chose to be a 3C0X1 Communications -
Computer Systems Operator. I enlisted for six years in exchange for
beginning with a higher rank. In September of that year, the World Trade Center
came down.

My time in the military was charmed. Over the next six years, I lived
in Mississippi, Texas, the UK, Italy. I also had a short four-month
deployment in Kosovo in the winter of 2004.


I did varied tech/communications work in the military. At my first
duty station, my assigned role was to be a System Administrator for a
small classified development network used for developing training
materials for intel troops and firefighters. But the programmers on the
team had it pretty well under control so there wasn't much for me to
actually _do_.  Instead, I leveraged my illustration skills and made
myself useful doing 3D modelling and 2D graphics and animation.
That led to making Flash programs of increasing complexity, and
ultimately sparked my interest in programming.

My other two duty stations had me working mainly help-desk and custody
roles, and don't have a lot of bearing on my current career, except
maybe for exposing me to Linux/Unix, and making me comfortable working
on the command-line.

<br/>
After the military, I essentially quit shaving.

### Failure To Launch
When my time in the Air Force was up, I had to come back home to the
U.S. I hadn't taken full advantage of my opportunities, and didn't
really know how to go about finding a job. I ended up back in picture
framing for the next few years. I had education benefits I could use,
but didn't think I'd be successful going to school and working
full-time.

Eventually I learned I was eligible for a different [G.I.
Bill][tt-post911-gibill] with more favorable terms than the old
[Montgomery G.I. Bill][tt-mont-gibill], which would allow me to return
to school full-time without having to also work full time to support
myself.

### Higher Education
In 2012, I quit my job and began a period of focused self-teaching,
mainly centered on math; I failed Algebra II twice in high school, and
it felt like unfinished business. I spent every day, usually from 9 am
until closing, at the library. I self-taught algebra II, geometry,
trigonometry, statistics and pre-calculus, and was able to pass an entrance exam
that allowed me to start my formal math education with calculus.

In 2012, I enrolled at De Anza College in Cupertino, in a
**Business Programming** Associate's degree program.  At De Anza, I
was accepted to [Phi Theta Kappa][tt-phithetakappa].

During this time, I was unexpectedly evicted twice. The first time, I
was living with a family of migrants and their many lodgers, and had
been for about five years. The owner of the house decided he wanted
to sell, and we all had to go. The second time, I had an informal
arrangement: I paid rent to the leaseholder, but wasn't on the lease
myself. It turned out he had a gambling problem, and hadn't been
paying the rent for some time. He abruptly left town with some rent
money he had collected from me and our other roommate.  He left behind
a note saying we had to be out by the weekend.

In 2015, I transferred into a Software Engineering Bachelor of Science
program at San Jose State University. During my time at San Jose
State, I completed the requirements for a math minor, was named on the
Dean's List several times, and was accepted to both [Phi Kappa
Phi][tt-phikappaphi] and [Tau Beta Pi][tt-taubetapi].


In 2018 I attended a job fair on campus, and secured an
interview, and then an internship with Intuit. Intuit has been my
working home since that time.

During my internship, I worked on Intuit's Identity team. Intuit likes
to give interns a single project to work on during their time.  Mine
was investigating and fixing an accessibility issue. The gist of it is
that the WAI-ARIA attributes were misconfigured, so if you were
unfortunate enough to be using a screen reader on the Intuit login
page, it would read certain things to you twice. I was offered a
full-time position on the strength of my write-up of the problem and
the fix for it.

<ClearFloat/>

After my internship, I still had a semester to go before finishing my
degree. My girlfriend at the time (now my wife) became terribly ill
with Influenza A. When I started getting messages from her family,
instead of from her, I knew it was [more serious than she had been
letting on][tt-influenza]. I got on a plane and travelled to Australia
before taking my last final. My professor was not especially
understanding, and would not let me take the final remotely. On my
return from Australia, I had a full-time gig in San
Diego lined up. So I still do not have a college degree.

### Hiatus and Marriage
In 2020, my (now) wife and I had been online friends for around 15
years. We had decided a few years before to make a go of it as a
couple, and I'd been visiting once a year since 2018. Getting married
meant an international relocation and becoming a husband and father
for the first time. Starting a new role at the same time seemed like
too much to take on. I spoke to some Intuit folks in Sydney, and had
reasonable assurances that there would be openings when I was ready to
come back in six to nine months. I resigned my position in May. In
June, I moved to Australia. In October we got married. I applied for a
new role at Intuit Sydney in 2021, and hired on in March.

#### Team Avalon
##### Major Project
* MCS OMS Migration

    Intuit's messaging platform, OMS, upgraded to a new version, changing the
    underlying technology in the process

##### Primary Tech Used
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Maven

#### Team Cronulla
##### Major Project
* Statutory Accounts/Books-To-Tax

    Began as front-end work providing a UI for a service that lets UK businesses
    produce their annually-required "statutory accounts" in the appropriate
    format for the UK's e-filing system

    Eventually, we took over responsibility for the entire capability

#### Primary Tech Used
* TypeScript
* React/Redux
* Node (back-end)
* Jest
* Cypress
* Storybook
* AWS

##### My Role
Contributing team member. I did a fair bit of React work. Significant work I
distinctly contributed was writing a cypress module that enabled greater
isolation in E2E tests by creating test accounts. I also worked on a side
project with a co-worker to simplify mocking parts of the Intuit application
context in Storybook.

#### Team Delray
##### Major Project
[Data Import From QuickBooks to TurboTax]

##### Primary Tech Used
* Node
* XML/XSLT

##### My Role
My role was to implement the transformation from accounts data to a schema that
the TurboTax system could ingest. I modified the existing pattern (one XSLT file
per form) to a more flexible pattern with one XSLT file that could support many
different output documents by accepting several configuration files, written in
YAML. This work also considered a lot of collaboration with PMs and tax experts
to get the mappings from account types to tax lines right.
